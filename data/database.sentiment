http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113501/|Just Cause (1995)|What can you possibly say about a show of this magnitude? The Sopranos has literally redefined television as we know it. It has broken all rules, and set new standards for television excellence. Everything is flawless, the writing, directing, and for me, most of all, the acting. Watching this show youll find yourself realizing that these characters are NOT real. The acting tricks you into thinking there is a real Tony Soprano, or any character. This show is also very versatile. Some people dont watch the show because its violent, its not all about the violence, its about business, family, and many deeper things that all depend on what you, as a fan see. For me, I dont like when people refer to the show, a show about the Mafia. For me, its a show about family. A family who, through generations, happen to be apart of the mob. Overall this is a masterpiece of a show. This is what television should be. Right here. Complex characters from stunning acting, magnificent story lines from brilliant writing, and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together? A show that defines excellence, and dares to be different.|0.322999941275|0.173855373598|0.677000058725
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113501/|Just Cause (1995)|The Sopranos is arguably the greatest show in Dramatic Television history.<br /><br />Its hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence, sublime writing or first rate performances.<br /><br />Across its epic scope it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality. Centering around the life of one Tony Soprano, a man who lives in two families. One is the conventional wife and two kids nuclear family the other a huge New Jersey Mafia group, of which he is the boss of both. Played by James Gandolfini, of True Romance and The Mexican fame, Tony is a fascinating, scary but also likable guy. Full praise must be given to Gandolfini for making a womanising and horrifically aggressive brute a genuinely identifiable and perfect leading man. Contemporay American drama has never had such an arresting and iconic figure as Tony.<br /><br />The cast of hundreds never boasts a flat performance and such stand out characters like Paulie Walnuts and Ralph Cifaretto will stick in your memory for ever.<br /><br />The true genius of this tale however, is the creator and writers bravery and revolutionary take on a conventional drama series. Twenty minute long dream sequences, powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery and truly shocking scenes of violence. Yet all this style is met by truly touching themes of love, honour and respect for family. The series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitous.<br /><br />With TV now competitive and often poor The Sopranos stands tall above the rest as Americas most original and compelling drama. Forget Family Redifined. This is Television Redifined.|0.144193446898|0.153660189858|0.855806553102
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113501/|Just Cause (1995)|First I would like to say how great this. It is astounding and sometimes shocking. And to say the least Im 11 years old and this is my favorite movie, I can definitely stand a boring film, but this is anything but boring. It is like a trip through humanity. Its stark realism shows through this monumental masterpiece. It is a heart wrenching tale of two down and outers (VOIGHT AND Hoffman) who build a mutual friendship. Joe Buck (VOIGHT) a naive Texan stud comes to New York to make it rich by entertaining women. Soon he meets Rico RATSO Rizzo (HOFFMAN), who is a poor man barely being able to pay rent. Ratso becomes Joes manager but soon both men cant find Joe a job which results in stealing food. As they try and survive on the streets of New York we realize how tough it is. They cant get Joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party. Joe makes some money and soon Joe takes Ratso on a Ratsos dream spot, Florida. The final five minutes are heart breaking yet some of the greatest moments in the film. From MIDNIGHT COWBOY we get a stark and sometimes disturbing urban view on life.|0.38912575537|0.766471737618|0.61087424463
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113501/|Just Cause (1995)|Sandra Bernhard is quite a character, and certainly one of the funniest women on earth. She began as a stand-up comedienne in the 1970s, but her big break came in 1983 when she starred opposite Jerry Lewis and Robert De Niro in Scorseses underrated masterpiece, The King of Comedy. Her film career never quite took off, though. She did make a couple of odd but entertaining pictures, such as Dallas Doll (1994) or Dinner Rush (2000), but the most amazing parts were those she created for herself.<br /><br />Without You Im Nothing is undoubtedly her best effort. Its an adaptation of her smash-hit off-Broadway show which made her a superstar  and Madonnas best friend for about four years. In ten perfectly choreographed and staged scenes, Sandra turns from Nina Simone to Diana Ross, talks about her childhood, Andy Warhol and San Francisco and performs songs made famous by Burt Bacharach, Prince, or Sylvester. Director John Boskovich got Sandra to do a 90-minute tour-de-force performance thats both sexy and uniquely funny. If you are a Bernhard fan, you cant miss out this film; its a tribute as well to her (weird) beauty as to her extremely unconventional talent as a comedienne. And it has influenced filmmakers in their work  Hedwig and the Angry Inch, for instance, would look a lot different if Without You Im Nothing didnt exist.|0.355648840395|0.165559133084|0.644351159605
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113501/|Just Cause (1995)|Jon Voight is brilliant in Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffmans performance, though reminiscent of his later turn in Rainman, is the kind of performance that keeps me watching movies. As a portrayal of a New York character, only Daniel Day Lewis portrayal of Bill Butcher in Gangs of New York comes to mind as comparable, and Day doesnt give his character the emotional depth that Hoffman gives Ratso. <br /><br />Its typical of Hoffmans way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in the history of film at playing off the people around him in such a way that he raises their performances far above their normal levels. <br /><br />Voights Buck is so naive that he would float out of the film altogether, except that Ratso pulls him down - pulls him down, but also teaches him, a lot about how to survive and, more importantly, how to live.<br /><br />Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself. I think that, as gritty a movie as it is, it has a very beautiful message, that no matter how much a loser you might be (Ratso clearly defines loser), if you can find a way to be true to yourself, you are in possession of the secret of life, and you might even be able to share that insight with someone else. <br /><br />I cant help but compare Midnight Cowboy to Klute, from a few years later, which I think is more like a movie about finding yourself that turns into a movie about escape.|0.134431901199|0.159633727079|0.865568098801
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113501/|Just Cause (1995)|I was going through a list of Oscar winners and was surprised to see that this film beat Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid for best picture in 1969. After actually seeing it, however, Im not surprised anymore. It was way ahead of its time in regards to its style, cinematography, and use of flashback to help develop Joe Bucks character.<br /><br />The most amazing thing to me is the depth of Joe Bucks character in such a short movie. I think Voight captured the naivete and the viciousness-when-provoked. The two scenes that really caught me were after he gets the blowjob in the theater and when the older man solicits him. I think when he looks in the mirror hes trying to see if its really him that has done- or is about to do- something terrible.<br /><br />I think it was a brilliant decision by Hoffman to take this role. Otherwise he may have been typecast after the Graduate. Anyway, this considered an all-time great for a reason.|0.531853092272|0.100484910342|0.468146907728
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113501/|Just Cause (1995)|What makes Midnight Cowboy into a successful movie is the way in which Joe Buck becomes bonded to Ratso Rizzo through a series of hardships that affect them both. There really arent many glimpses of hope in this film for either character, but the hard realities that beset them both give the film its own type of optimism that these men can at least find humanity within each other.<br /><br />This film features Jon Voights finest performance and probably Dustin Hoffmans as well. The rest of the cast is made up of unknowns, though it is rounded out by a fine series of character actors, including the cowpoke on the bus at the start of the film. Also, for those interested, Andy Warhols apprentice Paul Morrissey shows up briefly during the party scene.<br /><br />If you havent seen this movie, it is essential.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113501/|Just Cause (1995)|Midnight Cowboy is one of those films thats been proclaimed a masterpiece with good reason - it really is one of the finest films ever made in America. Its both artistically valid yet entirely accessible and commercial. No wonder it was a huge success when initially released. But be warned, its also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made. The characters are memorable, well-developed, and ultimately tragic. The filmmakers should be applauded for not giving us the Hollywood ending, something which was basically mandatory by the 80s. Still, this is why I treasure the years of 1967 to 1977 for American film. Its a time when well-made, innovative, and most of all bleak films could be made with the big budgets that Hollywood could offer. All this was over by the time Star Wars was released.<br /><br />The direction by John Schlesinger makes the material work. It combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing. Unlike many other films featuring these psychedelic effects, Midnight Cowboy has aged quite well. Its still as powerful now as it was when initially released. The acting however is what makes this a masterpiece. The characters backgrounds are never fully explained, but the performances make them completely developed. Both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic (despite their sometimes reprehensible actions). Plus, being a fan of vintage exploitation films, I loved the scenes set on the infamously sleazy 42nd street. Midnight Cowboy is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113501/|Just Cause (1995)|Midnight Cowboy made a big fuss when it was released in 1969, drawing an X rating. By todays standards, it would be hard pressed to pull an R rating. Jon Voight, who has been better, is competent in his role as Joe Buck, an out of town hick wanting to make it big with the ladies in New York City. He meets a seedy street hustler named Ratso Rizzo, who tries to befriend Buck for his own purposes. The two eventually forge a bond that is both touching and pathetic. As Ratso, Dustin Hoffman simply shines. Hoffman has often been brilliant, but never more so than in this portrayal. He is so into character that all else around him pales in comparison. Losing the Academy Award to John Wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Director Schlessinger has a deft hand with his production, but this film has a grungy underbelly that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer. Worth seeing for Hoffmans performance alone.|0.463980612021|0.155271651153|0.536019387979
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113501/|Just Cause (1995)|Midnight Cowboy is not for everybody. Its raw, painful, and realistic but very entertaining. The lead actors Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman who would go on to become Oscar winning actors deliver amazing performances. Voight as the Texas hustler, Joe Buck, who migrates from small town Texas to New York City to become a hustler. He does not apologize for his chosen profession but it is not that easy. The New York City women like the rich lady played by Georgeann Johnson and Cass played by Oscar nominated Sylvia Miles are different than Texas women. Sadly, Buck is trying to escape from his past life in Texas. He was raised by his grandmother, Sally Buck, played by the wonderful actress Ruth White who died in 1969 from cancer. The locations in New York City are wonderful to watch as is the relationship between Fatso played by Hoffman and Bucks characters evolve into a moving male to male friendship. The men are struggling to survive the New York City life by not playing by the rules like getting a real job. As the film evolves, Bucks past comes to the surface and its haunting but not clear. The film is not for children but compared to todays films and television programming, Midnight Cowboy might be more tame. I cant forget a young Brenda Vaccaro and a party that you cant forget. Its also a tearjerker of a film, so get your hankies out too.|0.11012697206|0.812106990604|0.88987302794
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113501/|Just Cause (1995)|Hardly the stuff dreams are made of is this pursuit of the brass ring by a naive hustler (JON VOIGT) and his lame con-man sidekick (DUSTIN Hoffman), soon to forge a friendship based on basic survival skills.<br /><br />A daring film for its time, and a foremost example of the kind of gritty landscape being explored in the more graphic films of the 60s. Symbolic of the end of innocence in American films, since it was the only X-rated film to win a Best Picture Oscar.<br /><br />JON VOIGT is the male hustler who comes to the big city expecting to find women an easy way to make money when they fight over his body, but soon finds the city is a cold place with no welcome mat for his ilk. Befriended by a lame con-man (DUSTIN Hoffman), he goes through a series of serio-comic adventures that leave him disillusioned and bitter, ready to leave the confines of a cold water flat for the sunshine promised in Florida, a land his friend Ratzo dreams of living in.<br /><br />But even in this final quest, the two are losers. John Schlesinger has directed with finesse from a brilliant script by Waldo Salt, and John Barrys haunting Midnight Cowboy theme adds to the poignant moments of search and desperation.<br /><br />Summing up: A true American classic honestly facing a tough subject and daring to show the underbelly of certain aspects of city life.|0.203510304305|0.811144156369|0.796489695695
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113501/|Just Cause (1995)|At the time I recall being quite startled and amused by this movie. I referred to it as the most important movie Id seen in ten years, and found myself bumping into people who said similar things. <br /><br />Bernhard has an unusually perceptive behavioral notebook. And she has shaped the bitter adolescent personality that we all had, into a corrosive, adult world-view. The two together provide a startling mix which may be too edgy for some viewers. (Hi Skip. I wish you werent my brother so I could **** you!) <br /><br />Bernhards search for herself after returning to LA from New York, results in the immersive trying-on of various personas (all of which fit poorly) for our amusement, but enough of them involve acting out to appeal to a black imperative values system that the real barometer of her resituation is whether black culture accepts her. (Its been a while. Nina Simone comes to mind. And she has an impressive, solidly-built black lover in the movie) A pretty black girl attends the shows, and seems to be authorizing Sandras faux-blackness, but ultimately rejects her.<br /><br />Just as Catholics deem themselves lucky to suffer for Christ, here Sandra depicts herself suffering at the hands of a black culture in which she craves a place; as if she cherishes her worthiness and her rejection. Its the only value system implicated in the films world, outside of Bernhards arty confusion.<br /><br />For a nation whose chief issues are racism and money, its refreshing to see one of the 2 topics dealt with in an atypical way.|0.337636536757|0.166681203451|0.662363463243

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114095/|Party Girl (1995)|Aim For The Top! Gunbuster is one of those anime series which has classic written all over it. I totally loved this series, and to this day, it remains my favorite anime. And while it was not Gainaxs first animated product, it was their first OVA series.<br /><br />Mainly starting out as a parody of the 1970s sports drama Aim For The Ace (Ace O Nerae!), Gunbuster picks up steam as a serious drama toward the ending of episode 2, when Noriko Takaya is forced to relive the death of her father, who was killed in mankinds initial encounter with the insect race Humanity is at war with. It is because of her fathers death that Noriko wants to become a combat pilot. But her lack of confidence proves to get in the way at times and she falters. Her friend, Kazumi Amano, even has doubts about Noriko being chosen as a pilot. However, Norikos coach, Koichiro Ota, has faith in her. And he has made it his personal mission to see that she succeeds at becoming a pilot, for he was a survivor of the battle in which Norikos father was killed.<br /><br />Other characters include Jung-Freud, a Russian combat pilot assigned to serve with the squadron Noriko and Kazumi belong to, Smith Toren, a love interest for Noriko who is killed in their first sortie together, and Kimiko Higuchi, Norikos childhood friend. Kimikos involvement is also of interest, as while Noriko is off in space, Kimiko remains behind on Earth to live a normal life. And because of the acts of time dilation, Kimiko ages normally on Earth while Noriko is relatively the same age as when she left school. By the end of the series, Noriko is roughly 18 years old while Kimiko is in her mid-fifties.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent anime series to watch if you are a fan of giant robot mecha and of Gainax animation. If you like Hideaki Annos other shows, or are a fan of Haruhiko Mikimotos artwork, then give this show a chance. It will grow on you.|0.230458633875|0.865013532179|0.769541366125

The various moves with the wrists had to be learned as throwing craps is a skill in and of itself.<br /><br />There are a few surprises. AS cynical as we are today, I fully expected the good girl to be crying over his grave, instead of his Buddys. Especially with her remarks about going to the funeral of her best friend, when she first meets Matt. And then of course you expect Matt to kill the guy who threw battery acid in Mr. Allens face, blinding him (interesting role by Bruce Dern). WRRROOONNNNGGG!!! some of the other Hollywood endings DO happen, but the writing is so excellent, the acting so carefully wrought that youre blissfully unaware.<br /><br />And the music is OUT OF THIS WORLD. Taking us back to the 50s when our native passions were first being unleashed by the music of Ray Charles and Bo Diddley. Even a little racism raring its ugly head in Chicago, but at a club called, wonderfully, Biloxi with a Confederate flag backing up the racist remarks. Ill be watching it again, just to hear the music. Good thing I have the FACTOTUM sound track, so I can listen to that in the car. Watch both together, and youll see how Matt has matured....playing bar room characters in both. NOw that he owns a bar in the Paramount HOtel in NYC, he probably has great opportunity to do his studies. Great actor, just coming into his own. He shows finely nuanced performances ...the good and the bad in his characters. His young boy off the farm is a great study, made especially poignant because of his bassett-hound eyes. He makes love, convincingly as well. Since he was in several movies with Diane Lane as a teen-ager, I wonder how that it ...making love to an actress you kinda grew up with.

First, its a fan made series, available only on the web, and it features mainly friends & neighbors who have the computer programs and home video cameras and sewing machines to, as Mickey & Judy once put it, put on a show. Its definitely friends & neighbors to, you can tell. A lot of these people arent the most beautiful looking folks youve ever seen, or the youngest, or the thinnest some of them stumble through their lines like theyre walking on marbles some of them have thick accents, or simply dont seem to speak well in the first place, whick makes it virtually impossible to understand a single solitary word that theyre saying. Still, you have to admit, for everything these friends & neighbors have put together, its actually fun to watch. Yes, some of the dialogue is hokey. Yes, its a little odd (though admittedly a little cool too) watching two Starfleet males kiss (although some of the kissing scenes seem to go on and on.) Yes, you cringe a bit when they clearly quote from ST:TOS, TNG, other shows and the movies, or when you hear the theme from Galaxy Quest played at the beginning and end of every show. Okay. We can get by that. Why? The graphics are first rate. Better than almost anything youve seen. And sometimes, a show or two really stands out story-wise some of them are actually real tear-jerkers.<br /><br />Hidden Frontier is a total guilty pleasure in every sense of the word but you have to give the people involved credit where credit is due. It takes a lot of effort to put on a production of this magnitude. People, sets, costumes, graphics its a huge effort on a lot of peoples parts.

Star Trek Hidden Frontier has taken on social context stories that Gene Roddenberry failed to bring to the screen and has shown the development of characters in long term space assignments - the real things that happen in close quarters as well as an exciting spatial wars and conflicts Sci-Fi addicts know and love. Done in a Green Screen studio; Hidden Frontiers brings a rollicking cast of regulars on to the screen and into your hearts.

It is hard to believe that this series has been going on for almost 7 years and will be coming to end mid-May 2007.<br /><br />I will not rehash what has already been said about the sets and graphics. Considering this is all-volunteer, for no profit, it is pretty amazing.<br /><br />If this was being ranked as a professional production, I would have to give it a 5 for a good story but terrible sets. However, as a fan-based production I have to give it an excellent rating as with the exception with a few other efforts, this is in a league of its own.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114095/|Party Girl (1995)|Hidden Frontier has been talked about and reported on by several news agencies for their long commitment to creating the best Star Trek stories and to providing an example of the togetherness that was Gene Roddenberrys mission. Their focus on homosexuality, depression, war, and acceptance of different races is on par or exceeds those of the other Trek series and movies. The production value started off as smaller and choppy but over the 7 seasons of production the acting has improved, the stories are more complex, and the visual graphics have gotten smoother and more impressive. In season 6 episode 1, Countermeasures, there is one of the biggest space battles in Trek history. The ships are rendered well and the space battles are impressive and exciting. The real draw to Frontier is not the ships or the backgrounds, but it is the people and the interplay and growth of characters. There are also nods to other Trek series and movies with places and characters we all know. I recommend any Trek fan to check out Countermeasures and you will be hooked!|0.156796457292|0.190762297746|0.843203542708
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114095/|Party Girl (1995)|I really like Star Trek Hidden Frontier it is an excellent fan fiction film series and i cant wait to see more I have only started watching this film series last week and i just cannot get enough of it. I have already recommended it too other people to watch since it is well worth the view. I have already watched each episode many times over and am waiting to see more episodes come out. I rated it a ten but i think it deserves a 12 loll My compliments to the staff of the Star Trek Hidden Frontiers on an excellent job. If u like Star Trek i highly recommend checking out this star trek fan fiction film. The detail associated with this series of films is excellent especially the ships and planets used in it|0.371205929005|0.141494215152|0.628794070995
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114095/|Party Girl (1995)|Okay, so the first few seasons took a while to get going on the special effects way, but from the beginning, Hidden Frontier has given consistently good story lines and performances, and have always been willing to mistakes theyve made. They advice people to see newer episodes first, so they can see just how good the show is, and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes. The cast have a fantastic camaraderie and it shows on-screen. <br /><br />The influx of guest actors who make their mark on the show and with fans attests also to the show, as the story lines go from strength to strength. The show has pushed barriers with its various story lines - depression, drug addiction and mainstream homosexuality - and these may have rubbed a few people the wrong way, but that is what Star Trek is and was all about. It portrays those story lines in a smart and emotional way, dealing with them subtly and smoothly. <br /><br />Yes, they have used some characters from Trek history, but they have done them justice - characters like Shelby, Lefler and Necheyev, vastly underused in the show, had a rebirth in the New Frontier books, but they lost their sizzle after a while, when Peter David when more towards wild fantasy versus serious sci-fi, and HF shows those characters in a completely different light, which serves them better. <br /><br />The site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and they can get to know the people involved. They release bloopers for every episode, so the fans can see what a laugh they have, because they are people doing it in their spare time, with a dedication that would make many professional actors wide-eyed in shock! <br /><br />What this series, now drawing to a close after 7 years, has accomplished on such a limited amount of resources is nothing short of amazing - bringing people together, inspiring others to do the same. HF will live for a long time after it ends, as long as people still enjoy the reason it started in the first place.|0.109856679379|0.17553896639|0.890143320621
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115907/|City Hall (1996)|As noted by other reviewers this is one of the best Tarzan movies. Unlike others however, I like the beginning of the film as it feels like a pretty accurate depiction of what a trading post must have been like. Plus the exposition is needed so we know why Harry wants to go back into the jungle. In addition the beginning of the film contains one of the most thrilling and terrifying chase sequences ever made.This occurs when Harrys safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals. The pre-censorship production values add a lot of realism, genuinely depicting the terrible dangers that awaited Europeans going into the jungle. The film also offers, though perhaps antecedently, an accurate account of how horribly treated the native Africans were by their white employers. In addition sexy Jane, thousands of elephants , some great sets and two chetas! Not to be missed an adventure classic.|0.150864581384|0.15714970252|0.849135418616
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115907/|City Hall (1996)|Considered by almost all the critics to be the best of the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan films, I have no argument with that, although there are a couple of others I thought just as entertaining. One thing: its the longest of the series that Ive seen at 105 minutes. Ive only seen six of them but this was longer than Im used to and with the drawn-out action finale I thought the whole thing was a bit too long.<br /><br />Nonetheless, it is a good mixture of action, suspense and romance. The only things missing are color and stereo sound. The primitive special-effects dont bother me, as that was all that they had back in the 1930s.<br /><br />Among some, this film is most noted for one thing: skin! Jane never wore anything this skimpy after this film as the Hays Code was instituted by the time the next Tarzan film was made. Her outfit showed what a great figure Maureen OSullivan possessed. The nude underwater scene, however, was not her - by a longshot. The woman under the water didnt have a good figure at all, whoever it was.<br /><br />There is plenty of action in here. Up to the finale, it was not overdone, either. The ending went on for 15 minutes, though, and was so intense that it was almost too much to watch.<br /><br />Still, this movie offers about everything - except Boy (their adopted son) - youd want to see in a Tarzan film, even OSullivan doing her Tarzan yell about a dozen times. With her pair of lungs, that was no problem.|0.722666665475|0.196491233738|0.277333334525

Once the viewer gets past the first three scenes, which are admittedly dull, Tarzan and his Mate takes off like a shot, offering non-stop action, humor, and romance. Maureen OSullivan is charming and beautiful as Jane and walks off with the movie. Weismuller is solid as well. Highly recommended.|0.330558852866|0.153900815748|0.669441147134

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115907/|City Hall (1996)|William Wyler was to have directed this adaptation of Moss Harts hit Broadway play with music/ recruiting poster-vivant, but his own military commitments intervened and it went to a most unlikely helmsman: George Cukor. The womens director has a sure touch on the many documentary-like sequences of Air Corps training, and he invests it with more unhackneyed humanity than the genre generally allowed, particularly in wartime. Sure, the gee-whiz (and entirely white, save for one unbilled Chinese-American recruit) bunch of newbies are nicer and more wholesome than in real life, and the speechifying about home and Mom and the wife and kid gets pretty thick, but its efficient propaganda and undeniably stirring. Notable, too, for the all-military male cast, several of whom didnt reemerge for years: Lon McAllister, Edmond OBrien, Martin Ritt, Red Buttons (in drag, as an Andrews Sister), Peter Lind Hayes, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Lee J. Cobb, and Don Taylor. Also for a very early glimpse of Judy Holliday, who doesnt show up till an hour and a half into the picture but has some good little sequences as OBriens worried-sick Brooklyn spouse. Too bad its rights are in a tangle and the only print anyone knows of is 16mm; evidently, after Twentieth Century Fox released it (to considerable success), the rights reverted to the Army, and if theres a good 35mm print out there, it probably lies somewhere in the bowels of the Pentagon. Its disingenuous and corny in spots, but it also captures the rigors of military training and the terrors of war vividly, and it deserves to be more widely seen.|0.514835295342|0.17427393081|0.485164704658

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115907/|City Hall (1996)|This movie has always been a favorite of mine since first seeing it as a 12 year old kid in 1962 when it was shown on a Los Angeles television stations late show. The characters are very engaging from the start of the picture, and it is too bad that the movie has never been released for video tape, nor is it ever shown on television (apparently due to a prohibition by the Estate of Moss Hart, the playwright/producer/director who wrote the story and first presented it on the New York stage during WWII -- the reason for denying its showing is hard to fathom more than 50 years after it was made). I did not see the movie again for over 30 years, when someone who had actually been a major cast member of the movie was able to get me a bootlegged copy on VHS (poor video quality, but good audio). My memory of it was correct: it was still an engaging and fascinating movie to watch. An amazing aspect of this film is just how many of its stars, just starting out in their careers at the time 1944), went on to became either major motion picture stars or at least well-known and fully-employed actors (e.g. Judy Holliday, Edmond OBrien, Jeanne Crain, Barry Nelson, Don Taylor, Karl Malden, Peter Lind Hayes, George Superman) Reeves, Red Buttons, Lee J. Cobb, Kevin McCarthy, and Gary Merrill). The scenes with the B-24 Liberators are terrific, especially the close-up shots where the details of the giant (for those times) 4-engine bomber (then 18,000+ manufactured, now nearly extinct) can be seen. Good insight into the different levels of training that a pilot-cadet went through on his way to being assigned to a bomber crew (of course, VERY gender-biased as was the trend of the day: only the MEN became pilots, the women just supported them in their roles -- hardly acceptable in todays world). I hope someday it will be released onto video for a new generation to enjoy.|0.503530271551|0.150817136894|0.496469728449
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115907/|City Hall (1996)|I had a personal interest in this movie. When I was 17 and just out of high school I got a job at 20th Century Fox as a member of the Laborers and Hod Carriers Union. At the end of my first day (sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier) I was told to bring a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes etc. for one or two weeks. When I arrived the next morning a bus was waiting and about 20 of us headed south toward San Diego. Just short of there we stopped at an army base called either Camp Callan or Camp Hahn. Once we were bunked in we went north a few miles into Camp Pendleton, the big Marine base. There, on the beach, we started building what was supposed to be a Japanese Pacific island base. It took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation, which included a water tank, gun entrenchments, sand-bagged trenches and living quarters. All this was at very high pay, sometimes golden time, which was triple our regular hourly wage. Our food was also first rate = prime rib at lunch, etc. - which was amazing because it was wartime and very hard to get good meat at home.<br /><br />Once the job was finished I waited eagerly for the movie to come out, which was about eight or ten months later. Then I waited eagerly through two hours of the movie before my handiwork finally came on screen. Then it was no more than three or four minutes (maybe less) of the movies heroes dive bombing the base and blowing it to smithereens. A bit disappointing, but still fun. <br /><br />In spite of the disappointment I enjoyed the movie and have not seen it since. I learned later that this movie was underwritten by the government and Fox was paid on a cost plus basis, which maybe accounts for our extravagant pay and lifestyle down there.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115907/|City Hall (1996)|Ossessione<br /><br />Luchino Viscontis debut film, this Italian noir is generally credited with launching the Neorealist movement--well, it says so right on the back of the box--and is a sometimes penetrating, sometimes lugubrious portrait of lonesome individuals in moral flux. Set in Fascist Italy, an assortment of supporting characters--including an ingenuous drifter who espouses Communist virtues--embody the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without, drifting phantasms longing for a soul. Although Viscontis compassion for the disenfranchised and his ability to express their lamentable conditions was already well-developed, the spider web of deceit is tenuous--although a staple of noir is to posit a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale, Gino here is so unhinged to begin with that you fear he might deserve it--the cosmic irony too didactic, the illicit relationship strained with bathos. All the same, its incisive and essential, although its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable.|0.236196814666|0.26972350971|0.763803185334
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115907/|City Hall (1996)|Oh, those sneaky Italians. Its not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the, in this case, author of the novel. Of course this is not something that is typically Italian but got done quite a lot in the early days of cinema, mostly because they often thought they would be able to get away with it. James M. Cains publishers managed to keep this movie off American screens until 1976 but nevertheless the movie itself has grown a bit into a well known classic.<br /><br />The movie is not as great to watch as the 1946 American version but its a great movie nevertheless. This of course not in the least is due to the movie its great strong story, that is an intriguing one and provides the movie with some great characters and realism. It follows the novel quite closely and is therefore mostly the same as other movie versions of its story, with of course as a difference that it got set in an Italian environment.<br /><br />Leave it up to the Italians to make a movie about life and the real people in it. These early dramas always have a very realistic feeling over it and are therefore also quite involving to watch. Unfortunately the movie lost some of its power toward the end, when the movie started to feel a bit overlong and dragging in parts. The movie could had easily ended 15 minutes earlier.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I dont really have much else negative to say about this movie. Its simply a greatly made one, based on some equally great and strong source material. Quite an impressive directorial debut for Luchino Visconti, who continued to direct some many more great and memorable Italian dramatic movies.<br /><br />8/10|0.253895437277|0.177441082826|0.746104562723

It is not the best version of Cains story (I like the 1981 version best), but thanks to Viscontis excellent direction and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very sensual couple), it is a must for noir fans. Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect. The film is not perfect, though. My main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good; the story moves at a very slow pace (I dont think Visconti was very good at editing his films). I think film noir works better with a short running time. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested.

As a therapist who has seen both the good and the bad of the community mental health and foster system, I though it was rather refreshing to see a movie that showed both the ups and downs of this system: people jumping from family to family, biological parents not always taking an active involvement, and transitions that can be but heart-wrenching and heart-melting.

Sanders (Ranch Wilder), Neal McDonough (Whitt Bass) and a seasoned veteran in one of his final performances, Ben Johnson (Hank Murphy, the owner of the California Angels), and the rest of the cast does a great job, plus a great storyline that is uplifting to pretty much anyone, I dont care what recesses of depression youre in.

Danny Glover, Tony Danza, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and especially Christopher Lloyed are well-cast in this charming movie about real-life angels helping the Angels baseball team. You never know, it could happen. I loved Lloyds role in it. He was hilarious. The story is about turning your life around, as the kids belief in Angels helped turn around angry, hardened, and embittered manager Glover see the best in people. The movie was well made and also about seeing the best in people and reaching your dreams. It was funny, charming, touching, and sad, all very nicely done. You will like (or love) it.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0171736/|Shall We Dance? (1996)|I saw this film on TV many years ago and I saw this film when I got this on tape. I thought that this was reasonably well done. It was not the best of all movies, but it was good enough. The movie has enough talent to inspire many people, especially younger kids. The acting was good, with Danny Glover leading the cast. The plot line was not very believable, but the script was well written. This movie can also be the interest of avid baseball fans. It does not directly apply to a action-packed sports movie. It directly applies to a nice film that you can watch with your family and learn some messages that are hidden in this film. Overall, the film was good, but not great. I give this a movie a 7/10.|0.298945277477|0.170138888901|0.701054722523

The actors are great and the effects well executed throughout. Danny Glover plays George Knox who manages the terrible baseball team The Angels and is great throughout the film.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0171736/|Shall We Dance? (1996)|I really enjoyed this movie as a young kid. At that age I thought that the silly baseball antics were funny and that the movie was cool because of its about sports. Now, several years later, I can look back and see what a well designed movie this was. This movie opened my eyes as a small child to the struggles other children dealt with and real world issues. That kind of exposure is largely lacking in kids movies these days which I dont think is to our societys benefit. Sure the baseball antics seem really dumb now, but they drew kids in. No seven year old is going to ask to see a movie about foster children, but they will ask to see a movie about baseball. Disney realized this fact and took advantage of it to teach these children an important lesson about the world.<br /><br />As a young adult the performance of Al and the other angels seems far less impressive, however I will give credit to the actors playing both children and Danny Glover who all did a fantastic job.|0.119954248998|0.144029564033|0.880045751002

It was on TV last night and I believe I hadnt seen the film since my sophomore year in high school and Im now in my 4th year of college. Although the film has many flaws, it is just so touching that you cant help but sit down, watch it, and enjoy yourself. It is also hilarious. Danny Glovers ranting is just so over the top that you cant help but laugh out loud at him at most time. It adds to the film and Im sure its exactly what the director wanted. You actually feel for the characters in the film even though the development isnt the best. A must see. I highly recommend.<br /><br />8/10|0.257894129001|0.155136106935|0.742105870999
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0171736/|Shall We Dance? (1996)|I enjoy movies like this for their spirit, no pun intended. Its a decent, clean movie about a baseball team thats falling behind, and a young fan wishes for them to win, since his deadbeat dad said that was the only way hed come back for him. <br /><br />The spirit shines through in two ways: A funny cast with Danny Glover and a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and the heavenly herald Al, taking the dynamic form of Christopher Lloyd. Its an energetic movie. It gets you smiling, and really involves you in the sport. <br /><br />Therein lies my gripe. the one thing that kinda bugs me is these sports movies that kind of turn you into an unexpecting fan for the team. Theres absolutely nothing wrong with that. I just find it odd that I should come away from the movie thinking the Angels are a strong, cool team, when really my base loyalty, such as it is, lies with the Toronto Blue Jays. Its interesting, really. If its just a movie about an underdog kids team, then its okay.|0.378948313307|0.127429176503|0.621051686693

The film has great special effects and acting from all of the films actors! The baseball scenes are all realistic! The music by composer Randy Edelman is very good and it fits the film very well! Some of the actors who reminded Me the actual baseball personalities. Stoney Jacksons Ray Mitchell character reminded Me Royce Clayton, McConaugheys character reminded Me of Steve Finley, and Jay O.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0171736/|Shall We Dance? (1996)|The film largely focuses on a bullying Robert Taylor as a ruthless buffalo hunter and the people who have to put up with him. Set amidst a hunt for dwindling numbers of buffalo, it portrays the end of a tragic era of senseless slaughter and is full of drama and remorse for both the buffalo and the Native Americans. Taylor is blinded by his hatred of Indians and his naivete that the buffalo herds will never disappear. In one scene, he shoots animal after animal, while in another he murders Indians and then eats the food they had cooking on their fire. Under this ruthless exterior lies an insecure person who is reduced to begging his comrades (Stewart Granger, Lloyd Nolan, and Russ Tamblyn) not to leave him. Its not the most pleasant of films and is weighed down by the drama it creates, leading to a dismal and very fitting conclusion in a blizzard.|0.400777313533|0.730225023459|0.599222686467
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0171736/|Shall We Dance? (1996)|As a baseball die-hard, this movie goes contrary to what I expect in a sports movie: authentic-looking sports action, believable characters, and an original story line. While Angels in the Outfield fails miserably in the first category, it succeeds beautifully in the latter two. Angels weaves the story of Roger and J.P., two Anaheim foster kids in love with baseball but searching for a family, with that of the woebegone Angels franchise, struggling to draw fans and win games. Pushed by his deadbeat fathers promise that they would be a family only when the Angels win the pennant, Roger asks for some heavenly help, and gets it in the form of diamond-dwelling spirits bent on reversing the franchises downward spiral. And, when short-fused manager George Knox (portrayed by Danny Glover) begins believing in what Roger sees, the team suddenly has hope for turning their season around--and Roger and J.P. find something to believe in. Glover in particular gives a nice performance, and Tony Danza, playing a washed-up pitcher, also does well, despite clearly having ZERO idea of how to pitch out of the windup!|0.30097949182|0.717810258573|0.69902050818
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0171736/|Shall We Dance? (1996)|Theyre not jawing journalists Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell from His Girl Friday or witty detective William Powell and sassy lady Myrna Loy from Thin Man, but Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson are surprisingly charming as amateur sleuths in Scoop. Their screwball repartee is more postmodern than post Depression, Allens writing filled with ironic self deprecation and plain old New York angst. Shades of the old wit occur rarely, such as when he, as Sid, the Great Splendini magician, responds about his background: I was born into the Hebrew persuasion, but when I got older I converted to narcissism. Johansson, fresh from Allens Match Point as a bad girl, here gets to be a relatively good, sometimes ditsy journalism student caught in a murder mystery suitable for London: a serial killer. The plot is a reworking of his recent London-based thriller Match Point, right down to the upper-class sins and the American Tragedy/Place in the Sun boating accident. As a matter of fact, Allen is reworking Manhattan Murder Mystery and Purple Rose of Cairo to name just a couple of other examples. I care not if he reworks; I would like the new material to be at least the equal of the originals, and, alas, it is just a reflection of his younger greatness.<br /><br />Allen as director and actor cant hide his love for the actress, as he couldnt for Diane Keaton, and therefore takes a middling comedy into an appropriate place down the Allen canon, not great but amusing, at times brilliantly satirical: About the suspected upper-class murderer, Sid (Allen) quips, Id be very surprised if he killed one person. This is vintage Allen humor. While there are barely any bright literary allusions as in most of his film, he lards Scoop with music from Grieg, Tchaikovsky, and Strauss to let us know the Woodman has not lost his touch of class.|0.421422751467|0.167019887489|0.578577248533
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0171736/|Shall We Dance? (1996)|In the funeral of the famous British journalist Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), his colleagues and friends recall how obstinate he was while seeking for a scoop. Meanwhile the deceased Joe discloses the identity of the tarot card serial killer of London. He cheats the Reaper and appears to the American student of journalism Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), who is on the stage in the middle of a magic show of the magician Sidney Waterman (Woody Allen) in London, and tells her that the murderer is the aristocrat Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Sondra drags Sid in her investigation, seeking for evidences that Peter is the killer. However, she falls in love with him and questions if Joe Strombel is right in his scoop.<br /><br />Scoop is another great Woody Allens comedy outside Manhattan, actually again in London. His ironic and witty lines are simply fantastic, and I laughed a lot inclusive with his fate of hero in a country where people drive in the wrong side. Sid Waterman is extremely funny and Woody Allen is in an excellent shape as comedian. However, his present muse Scarlett Johansson, of whom I am a big fan, has over-acting and is annoying in many moments, changing inclusive her accent to a histrionic pronunciation. Her character is absolutely silly and promiscuous, and I was quite disappointed with her performance (probably for the first time in her filmography). But this supernatural comedy is still a hilarious and worthwhile entertainment. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): Scoop  O Grande Furo (Scoop  The Big Scoop)|0.132761804508|0.580773961181|0.867238195492

The river Styx was pure genius. Sure, Woody was his perennial stuff, but at least his role was appropriate. The first half hour was really hilarious, and then the rest of the movie was easy to watch. The dialog was clever enough, and Woodys card tricks at the parties, along with the reaction from the upper crust, were fun to watch. This was much better than the newspaper critics made it sound out to be. And a plus, a little Sorcerers Apprentice to go along with it.

However, when she meets an ex con called Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan Never been kissed) they instantly fall for each other, but Jennifer has a different idea on where to take their relationship. she manipulates him to kill her parents, to protect their love but she just used him to get rid of her parents so she can be with Brad (David Lascher future Sabrina cast mate for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart actually really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator and she carries the movie well by using her friends and Nick so she can literally get away with murder. The rest of the supporting cast work well and they each hold their own when they have screen time. I also found it interesting that this film was made and released the same year, Hart, began portrayed Sabrina, the Teenage Witch and this shows she can act in my genres of film and television.<br /><br />Although the film has dated somewhat it stills stands out as some of her best work that involves drama or thriller and i am looking forward to Nine Dead that comes out in November because it shows she can seen as other people that are not called Clarissa Darling  or Sabrina Spellman<br /><br />I recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina.

I saw the film again this year as I am teaching the novel and find the changes in the film annoying - there is no appearance of the little boy in the novel and the ending has been changed. They kill him off in the film but the whole point is that he is haunted by the events at Eel Marsh House for many years but does remarry and eventually put the events behind him. Mr. Bentley is a far more sympathetic character in the novel, the scene in the film where Kipps sets fire to the office is plain daft, and the constant appearance of the toy soldier to signify the presence of the child is genuinely creepy but pointless - Kipps is haunted by the woman seeking revenge, not the child.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117093/|Mother Night (1996)|The Woman In Black was a British made for TV movie which was first broadcast on the BBC on Christmave Eve of 89, and again in 92. I believe it made a round on American TV on A&E. It was released on VHS in Britain in the early 90s but went out of print. A U.S. company released it on DVD later, but that version also sold out. According to the website of the author of the book, the rights to the movie are now owned by someone else and that it wont be released again, and that there are unofficial bootlegs being sold on ebay.<br /><br />I first heard about this movie just recently on a message board and had to check it out. I found a copy on ebay for about 28 bucks. Its certain to be a counterfeit from a seller in the far east, even though the DVD says, made in Canada, ha ha. But its a good copy, and you cant really fault the bootleg labels for releasing stuff that is rare, out of print, and lost in legal disputes.<br /><br />I love the movie. Its a period piece set in the 1920s, with all the very authentic and quaint British settings of that time. The Woman In Black is very atmospheric and dark. For the most part, the movie is very low-key, but effective and scary. There is no self indulgent gore, violence or much at all in special effects, but The Woman In Black is still able to create absolutely chilling moments. Its a chilling classic styled ghost movie. The movie itself looks like it could have been made in the 1930s except for the color. Without all the flash of all the modern horror movies, Im afraid this film will always just be a lost gem. For me, it places itself as one of my all time favorites.|0.481907947535|0.483038805023|0.518092052465

But then, Arthur attends the funeral, and from that scene on, we do not feel safe.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117093/|Mother Night (1996)|...On stage, TV or in a book, The Woman in Black is an outstanding ghost story. Other reviewers have already said just about all there is to say about this film, but I thought I would add my belated little review too. The made-for-TV movie has a deliberately slow first act, which chronicles the main character Arthur as he goes about his business as a solicitor in 1920s London. I can understand why this might not appeal to all palates. Nevertheless, for me, I love this British-style of storytelling similar to any of the BBCs Ghost Story for Christmas adaptations of the great M.R. James work. In the second act, the ghost story kicks in as Arthur is sent to the provinces by his boss, to tidy up the affairs of a deceased client. The third act relentlessly builds up to a spine-tingling conclusion... As a Londoner, I have seen the play. I own the book, DVD-R and have the unabridged audio book on my iPod, too. What is sure for me, The Women in Black on any medium is a ghost story with few equals. It is about time that we had a legitimate region 2 DVD release.|0.429125339318|0.172660756457|0.570874660682

To speed things up he decides to move from the local inn and take up residence in her home, a house that is usually fogbound and approached only by a causeway that is blocked off by the sea most of the day. Once there he sees visions of a woman in black, is she real or imaginary,he is also subjected to the blood curdling cries of a woamn and child apparently drowning in the marshes, these events take their toll on him and he soon becomes quite terrified. Atmospheric TV adaptation of a famous play by Susan Hill, that spends it first third building up its characters, before moving to the creepy country house, its poor colour contrast give away its TV roots immediately, this really should have been in black & white, but still as a ghost story it had a couple of unsettling moments, still though after waiting so long to see it I must say I was sadly just a little underwhelmed.|0.601836602077|0.844444439726|0.398163397923

I remembered it again with a disscusion with my uni friends and promptly bought it on video with plenty of hesitation I might add (to my surprise I only found it on the web in the States when it was made in England!) When I watched it again my reaction and to my surprise was almost the same, of sheer horror and fear and never has my heart been beating so much too. This is in my opinon the SCARIEST film ever made, Hollywood films seem tame in comparison and a bit Pony and Trap (crap), pardon the pun. What is amazing though is the power of this film and at uni when watching this with about twenty of my associates I have never heard so many screams, blokes as well! Even the sight of the video brings the fear of God into me of that one particular scene, and left me feeling that I will never walk alone again in the dark!!!!|0.594770237459|0.150765906429|0.405229762541
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117093/|Mother Night (1996)|There is nothing remotely scary about modern horror which is an insult to the word horror. Freddie Vs Jason, the Scream movies, Cabin Trash, and especially Stephen Kings infantile attempts - hes recycled every story from The Monkeys Paw to whatever, often in the same story - at horror in both writing and on film (except for Kubricks version of The Shining which actually was scary, unlike Kings books which are as frightening as my big toe - the left one, which still has the nail.<br /><br />But The Woman In Black is that rare modern film that will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end. This is the way it should be done; the director creates tension, and the scariest ghost ever actually seen simply by having her suddenly turn up standing still somewhere or other with that incredible look on her face. Then he brings it all to a ghastly disturbing close. Hes learned his lessons from the masters who knew how to make horror - Val Lewton (original Cat People) and Robert Wise (a Val Lewton disciple and director of the Haunting and The Body Snatcher), Jacques Tournier (another Val Lewton disciple who directed a truly horrifying zombie film, not the gross rubbish Raimi did (gross isnt scary, folks, its just gross), and Lewis Allen (The Uninvited), and of course Jack Claytons turn on Henry James The Innocents, and the way the master of suspense, Hitchcock, can still bring you to the edge of your seat even with a slow-building and burning period piece like Under Capricorn.<br /><br />TEN STARS...|0.671192630245|0.16227087086|0.328807369755
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117093/|Mother Night (1996)|The first and only time I saw the woman in black was I think the only time to my knowledge it appeared on TV back in 1989. It was Christmas eve and my father and i were watching it in the living room shortly before we all went to a midnight service in the village church. I was quite young at the time but im not sure who was more terrified walking through the church yard to the entrance of the church that night me or my father!.<br /><br />There are many factors about this film that make it so creepy but i think 0ne of them is the fact that theres not much in the way of a sound track that plays in the background of nearly every Hollywood movie, so every creak, thump and bang is more amplified in your head as theres no distraction. Another factor that makes it different from other ghost stories theres no jump factor involved like things bouncing out the closet so it makes it not necessarily what you see but what you hear and what you think is going on. This is a clever medium as nothing scares you more than your own mind running riot thinking whats around the corner or behind the door!<br /><br />A superb ghost story, Ive never seen anything that can match it and with all the dross thats repeated over and over on TV i cant believe the BBC has deleted it after (to my knowledge) only one showing!|0.53868507174|0.124387542462|0.46131492826

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117093/|Mother Night (1996)|I gave this film an 10/10 with some reluctance as its hard to praise something that so haunted and terrified me for years. The sheer menace on the woman in blacks face is just pure horror and the accompanying music just worsens the dread. <br /><br />I saw this when it was first on TV when I was 10 and it really did disturb me for years. Im fascinated by the fact that so many other users have said this too. So many movie reviews go on about how disturbing or terrifying a film might be but you can believe all those who have posted on this board, this really is incredibly powerful stuff. I mean I really like horror films and generally find them quite funny more often than not, but this really is menacing and will probably disturb most people. I havent seen it since I was 10 and Im tempted to watch it again but fear I might have some sleepless nights. I cant quite put my finger on what it is exactly, but I think its something to do with the fact that fear is the Womans greatest weapon and that we, as viewers, are just as susceptible as we feel the fear so intensely. Its remarkable that other viewers feelings are so unanimous.<br /><br />Ive also seen the stage play, which was an excellent production...but nothing can compare to this.|0.356479583|0.0853260887062|0.643520417

It really hasnt changed any; just a nice, safe, cheap, provincial little urban backwater that makes a great meeting place for international film types! Its also amusing to see Kenny and Spenny head to L.A. and find out that its Toronto all over again, only with a strange assortment of beach bums, musicians, fortune tellers, and yet more uppity film types.<br /><br />I dont see Pitch as a film to be enjoyed; its not entertainment unless the viewer enjoys watching someones aspirations being trampled. I take Pitch as a warning that power and money is really held by studio execs and production houses. Would-be (and successful) writers, musicians, and actors are still mere transients even when they reach the Big Time.<br /><br />So, Kenny and Spenny are trying to sell you a warning.

I still have the video tape, although worn out (over the years many friends and family members have borrowed it and have also been chilled by it!). <br /><br />Anyway, I remember coming home that night, grabbing a Christmas tipple, switching the lights out and watching what was advertised as a Christmas Ghost Story. Even now I remember certain scenes that still send the hairs on my neck standing on-end... <br /><br />I have seen some comments on the movie which say its not this and not that...I think those people get scared by Friday 13th and the like, stalk and slash rammel, which are laughable. This is a traditional ghost story; there is no big budget action or special effects...no swearing, no blood, no gratuitous sex scenes, no chainsaws or guns etc...So how refreshing!!!! Its atmospheric. IF you like chilling horror, well written, well acted and with a genuinely scary atmosphere, this is the movie for you. I like the original horrors; only last night I saw the original Haunting and that is a superb movie. Very atmospheric again - and so is The Woman In Black. The end of the movie differs to the book, but still very good. I recommend it. Try it...you *will* like it if you like traditional ghost stories...SO...turn off the lights, turn up the fire, lock the doors, grab a drink...and enjoy... :)|0.583944598179|0.172032176037|0.416055401821

Though the woman in black does not have much screen time, she makes the necessary appearances to chill the audience in some brilliant scenes. The dialogs are very descriptive and make your imagination work and thats when it becomes really scary. <br /><br />If you have the chance, watch this on theater its a totally different experience but as scary as this movie.<br /><br />This is one of the best Ghost movies ever and its directed for people that want to get scared.|0.148862283087|0.118055555603|0.851137716913

Apparently the popularity of the illegal DVDs lead to the release into the theaters, with still public coming to watch.<br /><br />The movie is a great epic, bringing Japanese culture into your house in an exiting way. In a sometimes humorist way, the story is told about a theater writer who writes a story for his theater, since the regular Kabuki theater plays is something he finds boring.<br /><br />At first, the audience might be a little bit confused about which story we are following, but when the story unfolds, we see that the love between a male human and a female demon leads to a great story for a new Kabuki theater piece.<br /><br />The audience is left in the dark if this is a story that is supposed to really have happened in Japanese traditions and mythology, but that doesnt matter.<br /><br />The way the story is told with a love for theater, expression, vivid colors, humor and tragedy, makes this a great ride on the roller-coaster of Japanese cinema as well as theater.<br /><br />Let yourself go completely when you watch this movie, try to see it in a cinema instead of on your television at home.<br /><br />One critical point though: the soundtrack is sometimes a little bit annoying. Though most of it is great music, there are a few moments in the movie that I think they should have chosen some more dramatic music. But maybe the fact that the story contains moments of humor made the director choose for lighter moments in music as well.|0.374428159904|0.187127726779|0.625571840096

The director was supposed to be in Montreal for the Canadian premiere, but due to health reasons, hes still in Japan...oh lord I hope he gets better and makes plenty of other movies.<br /><br />The plot is pretty simple, but somewhat original...the demons are roaming in Edo in Japan and Swordsmans called Demon Wardens are slaying them and fearing the rebirth of Ashura, the demon goddess whos sleeping and supposedly is very kick-ass.<br /><br />It brings us to Izumo...some kind of elite swordsman called Demon Slayer and his buddy Jaku whos the typical violent jealous asshole...<br /><br />Seems boring? Well now it thickens....<br /><br />Izumo took his retirement from killing demons since he slayed a young kid on the impression that he was the demon, he never knew, but he did killed her. So Izumo went on with his life and recycled himself in Kabuki theater. In a boat joyride on a nice night, Izumo spots a girl hiding on a bridge and it changes his life and restart to slay demons...for the good cause, the cause of love...and damn...the guy knows how to handle a sword and to pull an entertaining massacre.<br /><br />Izumo carries the movie as far as playing goes...he is the total package...he knows how to fight(hell yeah he knows), hes witty, hes intelligent and he has that grit. You never have to yell :NO IZUMO, ITS A TRAP The guy already knows it he has that common sense. Hes really the perfect hero.<br /><br />As far as cinematography goes, the esthetics are pretty interesting. Its by far, the movie that looks the most like a manga.

It is a great mystery about Mary (played by Alicia Silverstone), a high school senior in a California town whos classmates younger sister was tortured and killed by an unknown murderer. Mary meets Tony (played by Kevin Dillon), a police cadet who sees how bright she is and they decide to work together to try to find the killer.<br /><br />Many suspects in this one. True Crime feels very true or real to me. I read a newsgroup review where someone wrote that total suspension of disbelief is present here and it is so true. Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn do a great job, as do the other actors. The locations are right on and the writer/director, Pat Verducci, really captures some of the realities of teenage life and of Marys loneliness (see the scene where Mary awakens from the dream sequence after having viewed the photos she took of Tony).

Partially, but even without her, Id still see it. Im a fan of serial killer genre films, and believe this to be a great entry in that category. Also, Mary Giordano easily ranks among Alicias top five character creations. Totally memorable - like she really exists. Id have her on my side, too, if there was a mystery to be solved. She plays the character, like she does with her real life, with complete confidence in everything she does. Seems sweet, honest, nice...just like she is in real life. So is that acting? Yes, indeed, shes sort of a rebel once again. This time shes not bad, shes too good and a bit afraid to do things that seem above the law. But she doesnt do things the normal teenager would do. Instead, she spends her time reading detective mags and solves crimes. A cliche abounds: shes sort of avenging her fathers death, in a different way than vigilante-style. At the time, Alicia seemed to be playing the same characters: rebellious, seductive, without a parent, a loner. This happens here, too, but shes a bit nerdy this time around. That doesnt matter; shes still cool as a nerd. Check this out soon, or else Giordano will be investigating why you havent...|0.35120571742|0.150146203775|0.64879428258
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116477/|Hamlet (1996)|I searched out this one after seeing the hilarious and linguistically challenging Clueless (1995), perhaps Alicia Silverstones best known effort from early in her film career. True Crime has Kevin Dillon, which should be helpful in improving most film projects. In fact everyone in the cast does a good job . The only disappointment I think the movie has for me is an awkward feel to some of the scenes, coming from the need to run a quite uncompromising, grown up theme as part of what in tone starts out as a schoolgirl adventure.<br /><br />Alicia Silverstone is pretty good in this one. She carries off well the naive enthusiasm and growing unease that affects Mary Giordano as she manoeuvres towards the truth behind the serial murders. I reckon her characterization of MG has some mileage in it too. The inference of the story line is that she goes on to a career in law enforcement. It could be really interesting for an older Silverstone to revisit Giordano at a time of crisis later in the officers life. Just a thought!<br /><br />True Crime shows its director in a good light. Pat Verducci also has the writing credit. I dont know of any other film work PV has done. I can only wonder what happened after such a promising start.<br /><br />Like most productions, this one has a largely unknown supporting cast, although Bill Nunn (Detective Jerry Guinn) is hardly that. Over the past decade he seems to have been able to secure an impressive number of screen appearances. I recall seeing him recently in Carriers (1998), a made for TV presentation with a military theme. Bill Nunn played Captain Arends. Fans of the classic US TV comedy show Whos the Boss may also have an interest in Carriers because the leading player is Judith Light, remembered with affection by many because of her lengthy involvement with the show.<br /><br />True Crime could easily not have worked, but it does OK.

It is also about a space mission gone bad where the astronaut turns into a grizzly killer. Scared the Good & Plenty right out of me. The memory of those heebie-jeebies still lives within me.

He smiled at me, turned round turned off the lights so it was pitch black apart from the computer screen and told me to watch it. I started off fine...Then when he started getting worried about whatever was there i found it very unnerving. at the end i pushed back my chair and stood up...it made me jump!:P if you havent seen this film i highly recommend you do because it is well worth it. even after the fourth or fifth time its still unsettling.<br /><br />GREAT FILM!|0.660492664475|0.233335792918|0.339507335525

Theres nothing more attractive to hang on your wall than a 27x41 inch image of the melting man. However, theres nothing more awful to put in your VCR than an hour and a half long image of the melting man. At first I thought this movie was pure garbage but then I realized that it did have some qualities which made me laugh. The character of Dr. Ted Nelson has to be the most wishy-washy persona ever brought to the big screen. His dialogue is so trite its unbelievable! (Its incredible! He seems to be getting stronger as he melts!)<br /><br />And could somebody tell me please how the heck they know exactly how much time Steve has left before he melts completely and exactly what their plan is to help him?

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116477/|Hamlet (1996)|The Incredible Melting Man is a fantastically gross, trashy and energetic Z-grade production that every self-respecting camp-horror freak simply has to see for him/herself! The ideal way to describe this low-budget 70s gem is like a shameless copy of Hammers The Quatermass Xperiment ...only a thousand times filthier! Astronaust Steve West is the only survivor of a disastrous space-mission, but turns out the carrier of a horrible disease that makes him radioactive and ... causes him to melt! In shock after seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?), Steve busts out of the hospital, leaving a trail of sticky pus and fallen off body parts behind. Doctor Ted Nelson has to find him urgently, as the disease also set Steve up with an insatiable appetite for human flesh. The premise may sound utterly stupid but this flick is enormously entertaining and contains great make-up effects from the hand of Rick Baker. The melting dudes face looks like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like Darth Vader! Another big advantage is that William Sachs screenplay doesnt waste any time on tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches. The repulsiveness starts right away and lasts until the very last moment of the film. Just enjoy this silly horror gem and try to switch off your brain activity as much as you can because, if you start contemplating about the many stupidities in the script, youll miss out on all the campy fun!|0.684661646718|0.146194208655|0.315338353282

A great film, with real feelings, with great actors, with a great realisator-director. For me there are two films that everyone needs to see : the first is the Pacula ? Sophie s choice with Meryl Streep. The second is Journey of Hope. As human beings, we need to learn about humility, about love of the others, about acceptation of other civilisation, other way of living. We also have to struggle against racism and fascim. We must avoid judging, criticize; we only have to love our earth companion. This wonderful film, helps us reaching John (Lennon) his dream : Imagine all the people living live in peace. These two films are difficult to see : watch these, but sure you will be hurt, but better.

Id say most likely he was in his prime back in the late sixties/early seventies and anything lately has been a bit TOO strange for me, and it takes a lot for me to declare that. Anyway, this is like one big bad dream where parts of it seem to come true at various points. This woman is an actress or something, performs in some theater in Berlin where acts of fake torture are performed for an appreciative audience (?!) and she seems to have this problem with dreaming. The catch to whats real and whats not in this movie is apparently the real stuff is in sharp focus and the dream stuff isnt. She seems to exist in a state of deja vu. I wont say this makes a whole lot of sense but it is pretty wild and weird and entertaining. Shots of Berlin make it seem like a lonely and creepy place, so that adds to the atmosphere. The ending is extremely abrupt though, the film just ends and the tape went black, I guess no need to let you know it was over at that point. My copy was from the Anchor Bay Euro-Trash collection, and I say, give me more Euro-Trash, I cant get enough of that crap. But its GOOD crap.|0.704561247982|0.128456790136|0.295438752018

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114287/|Rob Roy (1995)|As you probably already know, Jess Franco is one prolific guy. Hes made hundreds upon hundreds of films, many of which are crap. However, he managed to sneak in an occasionally quality work amongst all the assembly line exploitation. Succubus isnt his best work (thats either The Diabolical Dr. Z or Vampyros Lesbos), but it has many of his trademarks that make it a must for anyone interested in diving into his large catalog. He combines the erotic (alternating between showing full-frontal nudity and leaving somethings left to the imagination) and the surreal seamlessly. This is a very dreamlike film, full of great atmosphere. I particularly liked the constant namedropping. Despite coming off as being incredibly pretentious, its amusing to hear all of Francos influences.<br /><br />Still, there are many users who dont like Succubus and I can see where theyre coming from. Its leisurely paced, but I can deal with that. More problematic is the incoherency. The script here was obviously rushed, and within five minutes into the film I had absolutely no idea what was going on (and it never really came together from that point on). Those who want some substance with their style, look elsewhere. Also, if its a horror film, it never really becomes scary or even suspenseful. Still, I was entertained by all the psychedelic silliness that I didnt really mind these major flaws all too much. (7/10)|0.627026430169|0.119174605851|0.372973569831

True, much of his work can be viewed as entertaining sleaze but with Succubus (Necronomicon) he shows what he is truly capable of when he lets his warped creativity run riot and gives us a film that is both hypnotic and enigmatic whilst still maintaining the delirious eroticism intrinsic in his work. Jerry Van Rooyens splendid score pulsates as the viewer is thrown from one bizarre scenario to another as we follow the trials of a striptease artist (Reynaud) who may be schizophrenic, or may indeed (as one mysterious character states) be a devil, attempt to come to terms with the world she inhabits.

The delicious Mathilda May, who spent most of Tobe Hoopers Lifeforce in the buff, is the object of young Biel Durans pre-teen lust. He cant get Mays breasts out of his mind and wants so badly to suckle them and suckle the breasts of his own mother, too. His pursuit of May IS the film. As in Luna works such as Lulu and Jamon! Jamon!, the director brings a slightly warped sexual sensibility to his strange but beautiful tale. The usual suspects will be offended, but those with open minds will enjoy this frothy erotic poem to the female breast. José Luis Alcaines images are gorgeous and Nicola Piovanis score is sweet and rich.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114287/|Rob Roy (1995)|I enjoyed a lot watching this movie. It has a great direction, by the already know Bigas Luna, born in Spain. And it is precisely in Spain that the movie takes place, in Cataluña, to be more precise.<br /><br />Luna explores once more the theme of an obcession, in this case the obcession of a young boy for the womens milk. There are some psychological concepts in this story such as the rejection complex that the elder son feels with the birth of his brother. In the movie this is what leads to the obcession of the young boy who suddenly sees all his mothers milk go to the recently born son. So he starts trying to find a breast who is able to feed him. He finds it in a woman recently arrived and from here on the movie is all around this.<br /><br />This movie lives a lot on imagery, more than the story itself, the espectator captures certain moments (unforgettable moments) and certain symbols (the movie deserves a thourough analyses on almost everything that happens because it usually means something...). The surroundings, the landscapes, typical from the region as well as the surreal behaviors of the characters, also symbolic, and the excelent ambiguous soundtrack by Nicola Piovani transport us to another dimension, not parallel to the real world, but which intersects it from times to times... Worth living in that world, worth watching this movie, even though we may eventually and for moments get tired and a bit sick with the excessive obcession, which is perhaps taken beyond the limits...<br /><br />I also enjoyed the performance of the protagonist... 8/10|0.134780588769|0.689500003883|0.865219411231

The film is impeccably made - for its time. It was remade in 2000 as Under Suspicion and if you only want to see one version of the story (thats all it deserves, really), I recommend the latter one, with Hopkins up-to-date direction and the more explicit references to plot points that the original could only hint at.

If youre not used to french wordy films, based upon conversation and battle of wits rather than on action, dont even try to watch it. Youll only obtain boredom to death, and reassured opinion that french movies are not for you.<br /><br />Garde à Vue is a wordy film, essentially based upon dialogs (written by Audiard by the way)and it cruelly cuts the veil of appearances.<br /><br />Why does Maître Martineau (Serrault) prefer to be unduly accused of being a child murderer rather than telling the truth ? Because at the time of the murder he was with a 18 years old girl with which he has a 8-years sexual relation.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114287/|Rob Roy (1995)|What keeps us going - or at least what I feel the writer wanted us to keep us glued at an early point is our desire to know whether Martinaud has done the dirty deed. Without spoiling so much, of course there is a red herring and a twist. But then we discover that this is the story of Martinauds imperfections and his difficulty in coping. When there is the revelation - we begin to sympathize and pity him because as the story progresses we are made to think he is the sick, perverted pedophiliac that were predisposed to have in mind. One of those things he has to cope with is the distant gap he and his wife have even though they live on the same roof. These problems of course are given their denouement in the films shocking finale.<br /><br />This movie demands your patience and it has certainly tried those of restless teenagers sitting at the rear. They were heckling obviously because they arent partial to central location films. Although there is a bit of travelling, when we get to the woods and the beach. And we realize that Gallien isnt as clever as we are made to think he is.<br /><br />The Inquisitor is 5/5|0.599887275316|0.455196227437|0.400112724684
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114287/|Rob Roy (1995)|Nothing revolutionary here; just impeccably elegant, restrained cinema.<br /><br />GARDE A VUE is confined almost exclusively to a drab police station, and mostly to one interrogation room, but director Claude Miller (who made the wonderful film THIS SWEET SICKNESS, among others) intercalates spare glimpses of exterior tableaux as minimalist locale scenography. Millers restraint, especially early on, is breathtaking, and his exquisite handling of the consequently-pivotal interior mise-en-scene makes for captivating viewing.<br /><br />Lino Ventura is superb as usual, succeeding to legitimize a character that, on paper, is cliche: the laconic, hard-nosed, world-weary homicide detective. Ventura lives the role, making it completely believable, even though the script allows us little access to his inner workings; the film ends at the very moment it appears he will be forced to confront his failure for the first time.<br /><br />Michel Serrault is equal to the task as the suspected child-killer who shrewdly spars with the single-minded flic. The exchanges between the two are more-often-than-not pregnant with tension and the aura of a constantly metamorphosing playing field for a battle of wits. Serraults character is by turns deplorably haughty and cunning, and pitiable; then later....<br /><br />The message of GARDE A VUE, if one were to search for one, is a condemnation of police methodology and the kind of pressures that make a cop over-zealous to, if necessary, close cases at the expense of justice. For most of its length though the film shines as nothing more than an exemplar of how to turn a potentially soporific set-bound scenario into a suspenseful drama of the utmost cinematic economy.<br /><br />|0.577037583471|0.571554183911|0.422962416529

It was funny, sweet, fast-paced, and entertaining. The film starts out with two cab hoppers (Bradley Cooper & Justin Bartha) trying to get to the same area but arguing which way to go. That was funny, and then the film goes into some of the best skits I have ever seen anywhere. There were four amazing ones out of all the good ones. Those four I will start talking about. One features Shia LaBeouf as a bellhop at a hotel who finds love in an old lady. The next one features Orlando Bloom as a music maker who is doing business with a woman played by Christina Ricci. Another one features Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly as two people going to prom, Thirblys character being handicapped. The best one features Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as a bickering old couple. I will bring to your attention that Nataile Portman makes an impressive directorial debut directing, and writing a skit about a caretaker, and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are excellent as a flirting man and a hooker. New York, I Love You is definitely as good, if not better than the 2006 Paris JeTaime. The skits are well-paced, and the film shows how indie films should really be. The film, however, does not have as many famous directors as Paris JeTaime, which is why it was fantastic to live up to its excellence. If you want to laugh, see some great dramatic effects, see an amazing amount of great performances, and just plain be entertained then definitely go see New York, I Love You.|0.1175250231|0.105980364996|0.8824749769

Its not only once that you want one or more of the short film in New York I Love You to be continue. Yeah, some of the short films makes you curious, some of them very short, some of them longer, some of them has it definite ends, some of them dont.<br /><br />Most of the story presents the sad side of the capital city. It shows many different nationality background. Many of it, make it feels the same way where I have been once went to a capital city in other countries for a year where it has many people came from different countries.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097937/|My Left Foot (1989)|As it is generally known,anthology films dont fare very well with American audiences (I guess they prefer one standard plot line). New York,I Love You, is the second phase of a series of anthology films dealing with cities & the people who live & love in them. The first was Paris,JTaime, which I really enjoyed. The film was made up of several segments,each written and/or directed by a different director (most of which were French,but there is a very funny segment directed by Joel & Ethan Coen). Like Paris, this one is also an anthology, directed by several different directors (Fatih Akin,Mira Nair,Natalie Portman,Shakher Kapur,etc.),and also like Parisdeals with New Yorkers,and why they love the city they live in. It features a top notch cast,featuring the likes of Natalie Portman,Shia LaBeouf,Christina Ricci,Orlando Bloom,Ethan Hawki,and also features such seasoned veterans as James Caan,Cloris Leachman,Eli Wallach and Julie Christie. Some of the stories really fly,and others dont (although I suppose it will depend on individual tastes---I wont ruin it for anybody else by revealing which ones worked for me & which ones didnt). Word is that the next entry in the series will be Shanghai, China (is Rome,Italy,Berlin,Germany or Athens,Greece out of the question?). Spoken mainly in English,but does have bits of Yiddish & Russian with English subtitles. Rated Rby the MPAA for strong language & sexual content|0.320940058519|0.322367413616|0.679059941481
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097937/|My Left Foot (1989)|New York, I Love You is a collective work of eleven short films, with each segment running around 10 minutes long. The shorts dont exactly relate but they all have something in common, love. Every short is about finding love, either if its about a couple or just two strangers chitchatting.The film stars an ensemble cast, among them Shia LaBeouf, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Orlando Bloom, Chris Cooper, Andy Garcia, Christina Ricci, Irrfan Khan, Robin Wright Penn, Julie Christie, Ethan Hawke, Bradley Cooper, Rachel Bilson, and Anton Yelchin. With such a stellar cast and such an interesting premise, I was expecting a tremendous film; the problem is New York I Love You doesnt add up. It remains the sum of its parts. Some of the segments are funny, original and interesting but others are so meaningless (Orlando Bloom/Christina Ricci and Ethan Hawke/Maggie Q segments) that its appalling. The film is definitely uneven and has a very experimental tone. Story-wise, it seems like something a few film students could put together. Having said that, the film has some great moments as well, one of the best being the segment about an old couple, played by Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman, walking along in Brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary. And its moments like this, that made me as a viewer, wish the film was more consistent, because, theres a lot of potential here. But, as unsatisfying as the overall story ends up being, for me, the cinematography and soundtrack saved the all thing. The editing was perfect, the way the film was shot was very impressive and the ethereal soundtrack, couldnt be more fitting. In the end, New York I Love You feels like an experimental film, and as in most experiences theres highs and lows. Its how one looks at the film as a whole that will determine if he enjoys it or not. It might be worthwhile for some and a waste of time for others.<br /><br />7/10|0.391865465329|0.166586308067|0.608134534671
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097937/|My Left Foot (1989)|I cannot say this movie is a disappointment because I read some reviews before watching and it did not do as well as I thought it would have. The bar was not set that high, so the fact that my expectations were met is not saying much.<br /><br />The Good: The city of New York. If you live in the city like me, youll recognize certain places and understand that the city is supposed to be more than just a setting, rather one of the main characters. There are genuinely tender moments, humorous conversations, and plot twists left and right which all keep things interesting.<br /><br />The Bad: The first thing I thought after leaving the theater was that I wanted more, but not in the positive leave them wanting more fashion. Certainly the good skits/scenes outweigh the bad, but there are a lot of skits that fall within the in-between category, too many in fact, which is what ultimately brings the movie down. Also, New York Citys diversity, though hinted at though the many distant pans of the city and mentioned in conversation throughout the movie, is never really realized or analyzed to the point of doing the city justice. For example, many of the skits involve well to do middle aged whites. I mean I know the city is home to many of the said demographic but come on, Paris Jetaimes plot and character diversity makes New York City look like Lancaster, PA, or someplace really white. It is just disappointing to see the city shortchanged on its heritage like that.<br /><br />Still, even after having said this, I would recommend giving New York, I Love You a view. Who knows, maybe youll disagree with my opinion and maybe you wont. You will never know until you see it for yourself. This review is not meant to deter anyone from watching this movie, as everyones opinion on art differs.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097937/|My Left Foot (1989)|Japanese indie film with humor and philosophy where the three main characters run literally almost through the entire film, chasing each other due to strange circumstances and comical coincidence. As they are running, we see what is going on in their minds and how they got where they are at the moment. The act of running is a metaphor for these down-on-their luck peoples lives. In some way, what theyre really chasing for is not what they were originally chasing, but for meaning in their lives and an escape from their personal problems and broken dreams. Running makes them all feel truly alive. The big life-altering running adventure comes to an end when they accidentally get in the middle of something big, violent, and so absurd that its funny in a clever way. One of my favorite films of all time by genius director Sabu.|0.261021461773|0.828528755439|0.738978538227
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097937/|My Left Foot (1989)|This movie has a very simple yet clever premise - an unemployed man trying to steal from a convenience store, and the store clerk catches him in the act... the thief runs away with the store-clerk right after him. All the while, the store clerk is in trouble with a low-rank Yakuza chinpira (gangster). Along the chase for the thief, they catch the eye of the Yakuza whos been looking for the convenience store clerk. The story then moves into high gear in the form of a Tom & Jerry (cat & mouse), but is added with the dog chasing after the cat. The entire 2nd act of D.A.N.G.A.N. Runner (can be translate to English as PINBALL RUNNERS) is about the chase, and the chase goes on & on to the point that by the end of the 2nd act, the bum forgets why he is running away, and the Yakuza dont remember which of the 2 guys he is chasing, nor does he remember why theyre running away from him.<br /><br />Similar to SABUs later film POSTMAN BLUES, the bulk of the film is simply all chase and action, with plenty of physical comedy and dark humor injected to keep the audience engaged. What falls short is the ending, to which the chase stops when the three men run out of steam, and into one of the most chaotic Mexican stand-offs youll see on film that looks almost as if Sabu was paying homage to Tony Scotts TRUE ROMANCE (written by Quentin Tarantino).|0.426875276252|0.801875558081|0.573124723748
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097937/|My Left Foot (1989)|I finally saw this film tonight after renting it at Blockbuster (VHS). I have to agree that it is wildly original. Yes, maybe the characters were not fully realized but it isnt one of those movies. Rather, we are treated to the directors eye, his vision of what the story is about. And it does not stop. And to be honest, I didnt want it to. I do believe that Sabu had to have influenced the directors of Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels and Run, Lola, Run. But I absolutely loved the way the three leads SEE the beautiful woman on the street to distract them momentarily. I really need to see this directors other work because this film really intrigued me. If you want insight, culture, sturm und drang, go somewhere else.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097937/|My Left Foot (1989)|A lot has already been said on this movie and I d like to join those who praised it. Its a highly unique film which uses elements of different genres: drama, comedy, gangster film without making a mess of it. At points you just laugh out loud, at other points you feel for the characters whose mistakes and failures you watch. Sabus genius can be shown with regard to some sequences of the movie. One is that where all three men chasing one another have an erotic day dream about a young woman that they just passed by on the street. This sequence is beautifully done and illustrates the characters of all three runners very well. It is erotic and funny at the same time. Another example of Sabus genius is the part of the film where the runners get tired. First one of them, the typical loser among the three guys, hallucinates that the woman that left him for someone else is back again and you see them dancing with one another and in the next shot him dancing with himself which is deeply moving. All of the runners get to this point where they think that have something back they lost or are on track again. And at one part of the movie they stop chasing each other, running in line, just laughing.So here is it all the beauty and the ludicrousness of what we call life which Sabu manages to show throughout the film. His characters fail (do they at the end?) but he doesnt rob them of their dignity. Monday and Postman Blues that do justice to Sabus claim that he is a genius. Go watch them!<br /><br />|0.37813789861|0.188315912508|0.62186210139
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097937/|My Left Foot (1989)|An entertaining and substantive film, Non-Stop has drawn deserving comparisons with Run Lola Run. The film quickly develops into a chase sequence, during which the viewers learn about the three main characters through flashbacks and daydream sequences. The chase serves not as as a fast-paced climax, but as a journey that makes up the majority of the film. During the run we see the characters grow and momentarily forget about their dreary lives, about the macho roles theyve bought into, and eventually forgetting about why they started running in the first place. Much like fighting provided a clarity for the characters in Fight Club, running provides this films characters with a means to step away from the false values that we all allow society to create for us. Their running serves as way to truly taste life from an unclouded perspective, and all three find some level of clarity and joy in the process.<br /><br />My appreciation and enjoyment only wavered slightly in the ending of the film, where instead of learning from their experience, the characters seem to revert to acting out those false macho roles I thought they had escaped from through their journey.<br /><br />Still, the only true problem with this film is that it wasnt distributed outside Japan sooner.|0.450662045803|0.167620116635|0.549337954197
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097937/|My Left Foot (1989)|This is one of the movies that get better every time you see them. Its packed with so many original and unconventional ideas that you always find a new detail. As in Sabus subsequent movies (I didnt see Unlucky monkey yet, but the other ones are as great) failure, chance and humanism play great roles. The cutting and Montage is inventive and artistic, without the movie being an art picture, but a highly entertaining one. When comparing it to Run, Lola, Run you have to keep in mind that Dangan Ranna was made some years before and was shown on German TV as early as 1997...so its more probable that it served as inspiration for Tom Tykwers movie, and not the other way around. Complementary to the other reviews I have to add that I like the acting and the ending very much. This movie is a lot of fun in many ways, and it manages to deliver a message without being annoying or pretentious.|0.358189737431|0.165561875397|0.641810262569

This was a real show depicting family values. There may have been a weekly crisis, but it was the strong family atmosphere that pulled everyone together.<br /><br />Lorne Greene was dominant as the patriarch of the family. His words depicted wisdom. We often were left to wonder that Ben Cartwright, a widower, must have been the best of husbands to that poor wife of his who had died. He reared wonderful sons.<br /><br />Naturally, we all wondered why Pernell Roberts left the show. The show was a gold mine and Roberts surrendered loads of money when he departed.

It teaches good old fashioned values in a fun, adventuresome and entertaining way (albeit with a somewhat predictable story most of the time). Its also really fun to make fun of...you know, rewind and insert your own dialog, in place of the actors.<br /><br />I have my DVR set to record all the episodes and I happened to catch the tail end of an episode (just prior to the next one starting...so I dont know what episode it was) but there was an absolutely TERRIBLE sequencing mistake! Adam had handed Sheriff Coffee a small swatch of leather, which was torn from some outlaws coat as he tried to make his getaway, I suppose.<br /><br />Well, Roy happened to have the coat, so he laid it out on his desk and placed the swatch right where it had been torn from. The swatch was EXACTLY rectangular...which I reckon would be nearly impossible to tear from a piece of leather (post-1950s Naugahyde? Yes. Leather? I dont think so). Well, the swatch lined up perfectly and the mystery was solved.<br /><br />Not 10 seconds later in the scene, we see the coat again, still lying on Roys desk. But this time the swatch is more like the shape of North Carolina and is now in a COMPLETELY different place on the coat (but still perfectly aligned with the hole in the coat) and the seam (which WAS smack-dab in the middle of the swatch) is now gone...as is the seam in the coat. My daughter enjoyed a good laugh as we played the short scene over and over and over again! Its prime for youtube, I tell ya!<br /><br />We still totally LOVE the show though and the sequencing errors make it lots of fun!|0.286065085217|0.180696044232|0.713934914783

America epitomized the feat of the ultimate fatted calf country with big ambitions, limitless potential, and a very comfortable economy!! After a big Sunday dinner, why not sit back and watch Bonanza, IN COLOR!!! This homey western evokes an American tradition which accompanies the complacency of the typical U.S. household during the era in which it was viewed.. The breathtaking cinematography of Lake Tahoe symbolized an infinite prosperity of the emerging American culture!! Western Movies were so popular that Western Television Shows followed suit!! This was a period in time in our country which yearned for a concise reflection on our own countrys struggle for survival!! The end result of the trials and tribulations at the Ponderosa Ranch, as demonstrated in this series, sparked a realization that Americans are now auspiciously enjoying the fruits of the Cartwrights painstaking labor!!<br /><br />The T.V. Show Bonanza was popular for so many different reasons, mostly on account of the fact that the late fifties and early sixties had not yet established the divisiveness of two different cultural mindsets which was ready to surface with our nation! The unification of ideologies in the United States which prevailed during the debut of Bonanza was a big reason for the shows success!! In the shows later years, Bonanza had established a firmly entrenched core market television audience!! The cast to Bonanza became famous, and the wholesome entertainment of Bonanza encompassed a camaraderie for the All-American idealist!! Everybody liked Bonanza and a lot of Americans totally loved it!! Reflecting on rough and tumble family values is a favorite past time of many Americans, and the television show Bonanza was perfect for that frame of mind!! I liked the show a lot, and most people I know like it as well!! Certainly, my entire family loved Bonanza!!

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114007/|Nothing Personal (1995)|I am a big Beatles fan. My favorite Beatle is Paul and my least favorite is John. I already knew quite a bit about the Beatles music and the truth behind the breakup, as well as things like John Lennons family and Pauls band Wings. I was curious to see how this movie would handle the relationship between John and Paul so many years after the breakup.<br /><br />I was not disappointed by this movie. Although the story itself is fiction, many of the references that the two musicians used were very accurate. These included how Yoko Ono would always be with John wherever he went, the Wings song Silly Love Songs being the number one hit that year and the concert on the roof of Apple Studios playing music from the album Let It Be.<br /><br />The actors did a very good job in playing John and Paul. The accents could had used maybe a bit more work, but they seemed to act a lot like Ive read the two former-Beatles used to act like. I also liked the dialogue between them, which was basically what the entire movie was.<br /><br />The ending at first disappointed me, but the more you think about it the more you will appreciate it, especially since this was how it really went in real life. They also show the fantastic skit from Saturday Night Live in which the Beatles are offered $3,000 to perform on the show. (as compared to the $220 million others were offering them) Overall, I was not disappointed with this movie. It does really give you more of a feel for why the Beatles broke up and why they never got back together.|0.353184364983|0.123525949223|0.646815635017

The result is that by the end of the film you feel like youre actually watching John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The expected tensions are there, especially in the awkward first moments. But as the two begin to loosen up, the old camaraderie that made the Beatles work so well begins to show through. The bitterness is still there, and interrupts at times, but by the time John gets the idea to take Lorne Michaels up on his offer to pay the Beatles the gag sum of $3000 to appear on Saturday Night Live, the two could be the same boyish pranksters that terrorized Liverpool together as teens, and survived playing the rough nightclubs of Hamburg to rise to Superstardom. But in the end, this wonderful fantasy grounds us gently. We are reminded why a Beatles reunion was most likely never possible even before Lennons assassination: The two driving forces of the group outgrew each other.|0.39249934787|0.158021909078|0.60750065213
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114007/|Nothing Personal (1995)|I sat down to watch this film with much trepidation and little hope. I didnt think it would be possible for this film to live up to its subject matter. But it absolutely did, and then some. First, I must say that Jared Harris did an extraordinary job as John Lennon. At times it seemed that Harris was channeling Lennon. The resemblance was often uncanny, and he clearly studied Lennons mannerisms and vocal inflections. Aiden Quinn was quite good as McCartney, also bearing a striking resemblance to Macca, although he did occasionally trip over his Scouse accent.<br /><br />This work of fiction was well-written and well-directed. It was pure fantasy, of course, but sometimes I felt like a voyeur peeking through a keyhole at this reunion. The rooftop scene was especially moving, as McCartney told Lennon what he had never heard as a child--that he was worthy and important, and it could never be his fault that he was abandoned by his parents. I also enjoyed the scene in the park where the pair of them danced with absolute abandon to the reggae band!<br /><br />My one complaint would be this: I am not so sure that John was as caustic as he was portrayed in the film at this stage in his life. He had settled in to his domestic situation quite nicely, and he was actually known to be quite friendly when approached by fans. Only a few years later, he was very friendly when he was first approached by his assassin for an autograph on the day he was murdered.<br /><br />Mostly this film served to stir up those feelings again about what might have been had John lived a bit longer. I am quite sure the Beatles would have come back together at some stage. And I am quite certain that Lennon and McCartney would still be friends today.<br /><br />Well done, VH1. I will watch it again and again.<br /><br />|0.114228216252|0.141517331081|0.885771783748

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114007/|Nothing Personal (1995)|I still wonder why I watched this movie. Admittedly, before I viewed this film, I knew practicly nothing about the beatles. I didnt even know all their names! All I knew was that they had a ton of fans, they had some albums that some people claim to be the greatest ever, they broke up, John married Yoko Ono, and John was murdered.<br /><br />Also, VH1 isnt even my favorite music station, MTV is. Still, for some reason or another I decided to watch it, not expecting much. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it very much! The dialogue was written and handled very well with the occasion of a slight accent mess up. This is very important, because John and Paul talking is pretty much the whole film, allthough they are taken outside to explore more possibilities, and to keep you watching. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn give good performaces,overall.<br /><br />The ending was also very smart. I enjoyed how the movie gets you excited about the SNL performace, and then slaps you over the head and makes you realize that it would be better if they just let it go, and end it on a good note. My favorite moment is probably the touching rooftop scene.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this film to almost everyone. It is a very good way of settling your curiosity of what could have happened if 6 years after the break up Paul just showed up on Johns doorstep. Which is probably the main reason of my viewing this film, settling my curiosity on who the beatles really were and what could have happened to them after the breakup.|0.397544612421|0.142747466994|0.602455387579
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114057/|Othello (1995)|I really enjoyed this film. All aspects of the film were top notch including the most important, for me anyway, the screenplay and the acting. This is definitely one of Richard Widmarks strongest roles. He is totally convincing in his performance. Just out of curiosity, imagine how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum might have tackled this role. This is my first exposure to Jean Peters work that I can remember. She impressed so much here that I will definitely be on the lookout for her other work. Thelma Ritter, in an unglamourous role, deserved the Oscar nomination she received for playing the informant. This film works on every level. The black and white photography is perfectly appropriate and the story hooks the viewer right from the beginning. Widmark and Peters have great chemistry in their difficult romance. Strongly recommended, 9/10.|0.103423399167|0.125835433451|0.896576600833
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114057/|Othello (1995)|I watched this last night on TV (HBO). I have to admit, that the tension in this movie was unsurpassed by most other FN era movies. I loved the way Chip would be all calm one moment and then VIOLENT the very next moment. It was classic. Ahh yes. The dames, the villians, the cigars and thuggish cops! It has it all. This movie delivered all the goods to me. I especially loved the way they mixed communism into the plot, very common for this era of movie. Very daring also since blacklisting was popular in those days. I rate this movie one of the best I have seen in the FN genre!|0.272062706876|0.165522129442|0.727937293124
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114057/|Othello (1995)|Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the screenplay, Pickup on South Street is a tough, brutal, well made film about a pickpocket (Richard Widmark) who inadvertently aquires top-secret microfilm and becomes a target for espionage agents. Also involved are Jean Peters as a tough broad who is used as a courier by her evil ex-lover Richard Kiley. Its film-noir at its best and although the performances are very good its grand character actress Thelma Ritter who steals the movie. As Moe a weary street peddler selling neck ties (and who also sells information) she is terrific in a role that brought her another Oscar nomination. Its amazing that Miss Ritter was nominated six times for an Academy Award and she never won. This should have been the role that copped it for her!|0.146822202485|0.084805648933|0.853177797515
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114057/|Othello (1995)|Director Samuel Fuller concocts a brilliant visual set-up: cocky pickpocket unwittingly lifts some microfilm from a womans purse; it turns out shes a courier for the Communists, and now she and the grifter are being watched by the police. The Film Noir Formula is all its glory--before the ingredients became clichés--including waterfront locales, floozies, saxophones on the soundtrack, and one hell of a climactic fistfight. Performances by Richard Widmark and Jean Peters are right on target, and the smart, sharp script is quite colorful. Fabulous Thelma Ritter received an Oscar nomination for knockout supporting role as a professional stoolie. Exciting, atmospheric, tough as nails. *** from ****|0.240056077183|0.3151105569|0.759943922817
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114057/|Othello (1995)|The best of the seven Sam Fuller movies that Ive seen (including Park Row, Run of the Arrow, Verboten!, Shock Corridor, The Naked Kiss, The Big Red One, and this film), Pickup on South Street counts as one of the best film noirs. It represents Fuller at his most controlled. I like him when hes out of control, of course, but nearly everything in Pickup is perfect. The film is absolutely beautiful. Richard Widmark stars as a pickpocket who steals some microfilm that was meant to go to communist spies. Jean Peters plays the woman who was carrying the film for her boyfriend, played by Richard Kiley. Peters is forced to find Widmark and get it back. She finds him through a stool pigeon played by Thelma Ritter. Widmark and Peters are attracted to each other, which changes Peters loyalties (that, and the fact that she learns shes working for communists; the Cold War stuff is really interesting). The love story is done a little quickly and not entirely believable, but its not so bad that it harms the film (unlike Fullers previous film, Park Row). Richard Widmark is great. This must be one of his best roles, but Im not so familiar with his career that I can say that for sure. Thelma Ritter gives the most memorable performance. Her role gives the film an unexpected emotional resonance, and her final scene in this film is as touching as any you will find in the cinema. I will never forget that. 10/10.|0.175916272713|0.873484823015|0.824083727287
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114057/|Othello (1995)|It is always satisfying when a detective wraps up a case and the criminal is brought to book. In this case the climax gives me even greater pleasure. To see the smug grin wiped off the face of Abigail Mitchell when she realises her victim has left deathbed testimony which leaves no doubt about her guilt is very satisfying.<br /><br />Please understand: while I admire Ruth Gordons performance, her character really, *really* irritates me. She is selfish and demanding. She gets her own way by putting on a simpering little girl act which is embarrassing in a woman of her age. Worse, she has now set herself up as judge, jury and executioner against her dead nieces husband.<br /><br />When Columbo is getting too close she tries to unnerve him by manipulating him into making an off-the-cuff speech to an audience of high-class ladies. He turns the tables perfectly by delivering a very warm and humane speech about the realities of police work.<br /><br />Nothing can distract Columbo from the pursuit of justice. Abbys final appeal to his good nature is rejected because he has too much self-respect not to do his job well. Here is one situation you cant squirm out of Ms Mitchell!|0.47869440591|0.57285458344|0.52130559409
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114057/|Othello (1995)|I havent really seen too many of the Columbo films... actually, I think Ive only watched one or two, apart from this one. Ive always liked Columbo, though, somehow without even having seen that much of him. Peter Falk is and has always been the perfect choice for the character, because of his looks, his voice and his charm. The perfect proof of this is that though the series started all the way back in 1968, the latest(and probably not last) of the films was made in 2003. Thats 35 years. And Falk was 40 back when he made the first one. The series consists of 68 films(unless my count is off), all of which are made for TV. Everyone knows the character, even though no one has ever seen a film featuring him in the cinema. That is quite an accomplishment, if you ask me. The plot is pretty good. The only problem I have with it is that the killer and murder is revealed at the very beginning(though that may be the same for all of the Columbo films), leaving no mystery but how Columbo solves it, making it somewhat dull(since theres not much to look forward to at the end of the film). The pacing is good, theres hardly a scene where youre bored. The acting is very good, particularly that of Falk and Ruth Gordon. They have some great exchanges of dialog in the film. The characters are well-written and credible. The dialog and script is unusually good for a TV-movie. All in all, the film is, yes, surprisingly good for a TV-movie, and definitely worth watching for any fan of Columbo and/or crime/mystery flicks. 8/10|0.411423447377|0.149294871809|0.588576552623
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114057/|Othello (1995)|The Plainsman represents the directorial prowess of Cecil B. DeMille at its most inaccurate and un-factual. It sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln to interact, even though in reality Lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place. Every once in a while DeMille floats dangerously close toward the truth, but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship. The film is an attempt to buttress Custers last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people, who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends. Truly, this is the world according to DeMille - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment, but a pretty campy relic by todays standards.<br /><br />TRANSFER: Considering the vintage of the film, this is a moderately appealing transfer, with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks. Theres a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments. All in all, the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent, but it is never all bad or all good  just a bit better than middle of the road. Age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract. The audio is mono but nicely balanced.<br /><br />EXTRAS: Forget it. Its Universal! BOTTOM LINE: As pseudo-history painted on celluloid, this western is compelling and fun. Just take its characters and story with a grain of salt  in some cases  a whole box seems more appropriate!|0.469376878095|0.207716049692|0.530623121905
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114057/|Othello (1995)|This is the one in which the diminutive Ruth Gordon plays an Agatha-Christie type of murder mystery author who locks her nephew by marriage into a safe. Gordon believes that he murdered her niece and the young fellow dies of suffocation, while Gordon is traveling back and forth to New York. He manages, however, to leave behind some clues, scratches on a couple of black safe deposit boxes and an improvised and well-hidden note. Columbo enters the case, suspects her at once, and solves the mystery by simply using his supernatural mystical intuitive powers. Oh, and Mariette Hartley is on hand as Gordons secretary and would-be blackmailer. Hartley is, I believe, the grand daughter of the psychologist B. F. Skinner. Im not sure her ancestry had anything to do with her attractive belly button, which is on display during a belly dance sequence, but Ive always admired Skinner anyway.<br /><br />The murder is well handled. Its a good plot, and none of the performers or crew fluff anything. But the outstanding figure here is Ruth Gordon, only a skosh over five feet tall. She was over 80 years old and looked it. There are moments when she almost teeters, but she consistently exudes charm. Her acting is idiosyncratic. You can never be sure when shes being serious or when shes putting Columbo and the audience on. Shes given some good lines too. What humor there is comes from Gordon. Columbo doesnt have any of his frequent comic moments.<br /><br />All in all, a nice job by everyone concerned.|0.571791535768|0.519911531821|0.428208464232
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114057/|Othello (1995)|I loved the episode but seems to me there should have been some quick reference to the secretary getting punished for effectively being an accomplice after the fact. While I like when a episode of Columbo has an unpredictable twist like this one, its resolution should be part of the conclusion of the episode, along with the uncovering of the murderer.<br /><br />The interplay between Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon is priceless. At one point, Gordon, playing a famous writer, makes some comment about being flattered by the famous Lt. Columbo, making a tongue-in-cheek allusion to the detectives real life fame as a crime-solver. This is one of the best of many great Columbo installments.|0.104021731362|0.098368051339|0.895978268638

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066817/|Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971)|This tragicomedy written by famous Serbian theatre/film writer Dusan Kovacevic is probably one of the best movies ever made in the comedy category. And yet, its appearance of a theatre play transformed into a feature film takes nothing of its value. A masterpiece one should not miss to see (preferably with subtitles, and not dubbed).<br /><br />In an aged bus en route to capital Belgrade, a looming war decides the passengers behaviour. Two Gypsy musicians sing of their miserable life but also foresee a tragedy to come; their singing both divides and connects stages in this extraordinary road movie (real life Kostic brothers are amateur actors, but together with Stanojlo Milinkovic as farmer whos plowed the road give a real-life performance).<br /><br />The spectrum of characters gives a brilliant image of a society facing a war, an insight into nations collective person: everyone is aware that war is just about to begin but they try to live their own lives the best they can, hoping that ignorance might avert the tragedy. Using a simple movie language, director Slobodan Sijan paints a picture of society torn by previous war (World War I), but also highlights personal portraits with success: provincialism of a singer, inexperience of the newlyweds, seriousness of the Great War veteran who is on way to visit his recently conscripted son, and gloomy predictions from a man who seems to be a German spy.<br /><br />Brilliant in its narration, with memorable soundtrack (especialy the Gispsy songs) and adjusted atmosphere, well photographed and edited, this feature (Sijans feature debut) was only an introduction into a series of the directors bitter-sweet comedies that will define Serbian cinematography of the 1980s: Maratonci trce pocasni krug, Kako sam sistematski unisten od idiota, and my other directors favourite Davitelj protiv davitelja).|0.237647742879|0.115959873443|0.762352257121

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066817/|Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971)|I think Charlotte Gainsbourg is one of the best performers in the world. I cant understand why some people say shes not. Boring....??? Maybe the one who said shes boring is because he/she is boring. Shes a great actress and the movie was excellent. It has lots of wonderful ideas and very good performers. The direction was great. I imaging myself in the French environment with all the sophistication and perfume, flowers, churches, problems, etc. When she goes to the sisters shop is simply amazing. Everythings great. We have a very good actress, wonderful, for long time. Alain Chabat and Bernadette Lafont are perfect. I like him more than in his next movie LA SCIENCE DES RÊVES.

The use of facial image throughout the film is superb, and his clever positioning of the senior member of the family (mother) is spot on.<br /><br />While there are more than enough laughs in the movie, it still deals with single parents/adoption and the strength of family in society. Truly rewarding to watch, and again one that only the French seam capable to make.<br /><br />So far one of the best 50 or so Films I have seen this year, and well worth a five start rating.

The storyline had gaps/jumps that I think throws the audience off a bit. Theres no great soundtrack playing in the background, creating the romantic ambiance. BUT they all didnt matter.<br /><br />The chemistry between Emma and Luis was simply exquisite. There was some inexplicable strange chemistry that I couldnt resist; I fell in love with it and here I am, writing this review. The subtle love portrayal by the two actors was superb, and I believe, that is the core of this movie.<br /><br />This movie is not an everyday romantic comedy; in fact, not all of us will appreciate it.

But, like I said, Chabat is a fine actor and he can do charm when he needs to. Im also gradually overcoming an aversion to Charlotte Gainsbourg who also turns in an accomplished performance. If you absolutely insist on knowing, the plot is the one about the guy well into his forties and more than content to be single. This doesnt sit well with his mother and five sisters and to get them off his back he makes an arrangement with the sister of a colleague to pose - for fifteen thousand euros -as his new girlfriend, allow the romance to come to fruition with a wedding and then jilt him, thus getting him off the hook. Naturally they wind up together but along the way theres some sub-Benedek and Beatrice duelling and all things considered its a pretty painless ninety minutes and performing so well at the French box office that a sequel may not be out of the question.|0.542967984514|0.458495606951|0.457032015486

And the tears shed were all of laughter. This film was hilarious, theres no other way of saying this. There wasnt one boring bit in it, I laughed right through it and with me everyone else of us three hundred lovers of French cinéma.<br /><br />Alain Chabat was absolutely terrific. A great clown if needs be and serious if the situation calls for it. The performance was of course completely over the top, but this was exactly what the story needed and what made it work so well. Equally great was Charlotte Gainsbourg who I love to see a lot, and the mother was also a very strong performance. The sisters could have been a bit more detailed in character script-wise, but apart from that there is nothing to moan about. I had a great afternoon seeing this film while Hamburg was drowning in rain outside, and I wish films like this from France would get a regular release in Germany. But the distributors is this country dont seem to understand that the French make good films. I at least cant wait to find a DVD which offers subtitles (Hello Australia?

There was good music, fun times and, yes, a few rough and tumbles at the honky tonk roadhouses. The relationship of Bud and Sissy, like two ships passing in the night, was well conceived. When Pam tore up the note that Sissy had written to Bud, it echoed the tragedy of many true life romances. The entire story was well thought out. I thought the cast and crew did an excellent job.

I rank it with The Wizard of Oz and African Queen, although it is a totally different type of movie than African Queen. Stairway to Heaven is a psycho-drama that uses performance concepts and technical effects that, to my knowledge, are totally unique. <br /><br />For example, there is the combination of B&W and color footage - as in Oz, but the significance of the contrast goes way beyond the simple - but beautiful - effect achieved in Oz. In Stairway the purpose and effect of the contrast can only be described as powerful.<br /><br />Another brilliant aspect of Stairway is the concept of time and how it is used here. How could anybody have conceived of a better way to make time stand still  literally? And then there is the Stairway itself!<br /><br />If you have any imagination at all, you will agree with me.

I think Travolta and Winger performed at higher than average rates, I think the sets were representative of the location and the era, I liked the sound track and the Charlie Daniels Band. However, I think the photography was amazing! Since the interior scenes were filmed in the actual club and Gilleys had low ceilings--perhaps 10-12 feet high and the smoke that was supposed to simulate a smoke-filled bar hung 2-4 feet below the ceiling. The Camera managed to get shots through the smoke and focus on the actors, the bull, the bar, the women, the dancing, the low-level of light that actually was in the bar! What a feat! Sure there was auxiliary lighting, but in order to maintain the atmosphere of the bar, it had to be low-light shots. Ray Villalobos (the camera operator) was outstanding! He got some shots he had no hope of achieving and the impact of them brought a sense of reality to the film. Thanks, Ray--Great work!|0.363888784813|0.167776305258|0.636111215187

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114746/|Twelve Monkeys (1995)|For Urban Cowboy John Travolta plays one of the stronger alpha males ever portrayed on the big screen. Hes a decent enough young kid who leaves his parents homestead and strikes out for the big city of Dallas where his uncle Barry Corbin has promised to find him work in the petrochemical industry. In 1980 that was beginning to boom and Texas was definitely a growing place in the USA.<br /><br />Travolta does a good job in making we the audience care about his character who when you come right down to it is a sexist pig. He meets and marries Debra Winger whos from the same background, but shes got some ideas that women should not be shadows of their men. And when she beats him at Gilleys mechanical bull, a mans game, thats it for him.<br /><br />Scott Glenn whos an ex-convict is working at Gilleys and this film was his breakout role. Hes a real snake in Urban Cowboy, he gets Travoltas goat with a mere look and he moves in on Winger. Travolta in turn takes up with rich girl, Madolyn Smith Osborne whos slumming at Gilleys. <br /><br />Despite the characters, Urban Cowboy was really one gigantic commercial for the self-styled biggest honky tonk in the world. Gilleys is no longer there in the suburban Texas community of Pasadena, but the memories do live on. And the best thing about Urban Cowboy is the wonderful score of country/western songs that were featured in the film. Im not sure if some of the songs were not written specifically for Urban Cowboy, but its the only reason I can think of why the Motion Picture Academy ignored the musical aspects of this film. I especially liked Johnny Lees Looking For Love, if it was specifically written for this film, its a disgrace that it wasnt nominated for Best Song.<br /><br />I liked Debra Wingers character best in this film. She doesnt lose a trace of femininity, but she stands up to Travolta and does it in style. And this review is dedicated to that yet as unknown woman who will one day be the first woman bull-rider in the Professional Bull Riders.|0.310532329764|0.850757522936|0.689467670236

In other words, the film is nominated and yet the director didnt get any sort of career boost. As for the black performers, I could understand this not causing their careers to shift into high gear, as unfortunately most of white society have indifference (or worse) for blacks or that kind of music.<br /><br />If you do watch this film, if you arent particularly enjoying the earlier portion, skip ahead to about the 5:50 mark--where it picks up considerably.

The director Gojn Mili was a photographer and that experience shows in some of the double exposure shots of some of the musicians that makes this one of the most innovative angles of the 40s.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114746/|Twelve Monkeys (1995)|Each of the major studios cranked out jazzy one-reelers throughout the thirties and forties (with Universal taking the lead). While most looked as cheap on screen as they were to make, Warner Bros. (which abruptly stopped making them in 1946) often distinguished theirs with offbeat camera angles, mirrors and optical effects, thanks to some creative directors like Jean Negulesco. It is fitting that the best of this genre should come from this studio.<br /><br />What sets Jammin The Blues apart from the rest of the pack is that it more closely resembles an avant-garde experiment than a Hollywood musical. Filmed in July 1944, it transforms an ordinary jam session into a trippy dream-escape from war-time troubles, highlighted by the tune of On The Sunny Side Of The Street. Gjon Mili and cameraman Robert Burkes (later to work with Hitchcock) were allowed plenty of artistic freedom, perhaps because Lester Young was not Glenn Miller and the studio could care less how he and his fellow musicians were presented. The optical printer is put to good use, with multiple images of the same performer appearing at once.

Imagine Rowan Atkinson resuming the role of assistant to the prime minister played by the wonderful Hugh Laurie. Hugh is sensational as the dimwit Prince George and Edmund as his brilliant assistant. I love the episode which Kenneth Connor guest stars as a British thespian. Every time, Edmund says Macbeth. The two thespians do a silly little act to ward off evil spirits. Its the funniest things that you will see. Of course, none of this brilliance and comedic genius could be without Ben Elton and Richard Curtis who are also behind the films like Love Actually, The Thin Blue Line, Four Weddings and A Funeral. Black Adder is funny and almost too good for television. Humor can be smart, sexy, and funny all at one. I was hoping last night on Saturday Night Live that Hugh Laurie would pay homage to his background in British humor.

This time instead of Tudor times or Elizabethan times, Edmund Blackadder (BAFTA nominated Rowan Atkinson) is living in the time of the French Revolution. Accompanied by the now stupid but lovable Baldrick (Tony Robinson) Blackadder is the faithful butler to George, the Prince Regent of Wales (Hugh Laurie). Throughout this third series to the wonderfully written sitcom Blackadder tries everything he can to get rich and powerful. He tries electing a lord for a rotten borough, tries to sell a book, tries to win a bet about The Scarlet Pimpernel, tries to be a highway man and finally poses as the Prince.

This `Wonderland fable is based on the true story of the gruesome bloody Wonderland murders that occurred back in 80s California. At the center of this bloodbath was no other than `Johnny Wad himself. Yes, John Holmes! Daddy ding-dong used other shotguns than his infamous 13-inch milk machine. Besides being a legendary adult film actor, Holmes was as also a hardcore drug addict who befriended various Hollywood junkies. Val Kilmer was occasionally majestic as Holmes, but for once this Holmes character did not milk it through completely. The film possesses a `whos who of supporting players: Josh Lucas & Dylan Mcdermott as Hollywood riffraffs , Kate Bosworth & Lisa Kudrow as the women in Holmes life, and Eric Bogosian as a menacing Tinsletown entrepreneur. These characters do play integral parts, directly or indirectly, in the `Wonderland murders. Out of this support group, it was Josh Lucas who was the most fierce & impressive as the ardent Ron Launius. Lucas is gradually escalating into a major Hollywood player with such charismatic turns in `A Beautiful Mind & `Sweet Home Alabama. Director James Cox sometime proved to be a bit of a coxsucker by displaying a vast amount of overextended scenes, just like Holmes famous organ. Holmes was eventually acquitted of the `Wonderland murders.

Only Susan survives.<br /><br />Main Suspect: John Holmes (Val Kilmer), former king of porn, owner of a 30 cm long dick, and now a hopeless addict.<br /><br />Two investigators, Luis (Frankie G.) and Sam Nico (Ted Levine), are investigating on the case and try to crack it with the help of a witness that claims to know that John at the very least took part in the murders, David Lind (Dylan McDermott), Barbaras boyfriend, and trying to get a witness report out of Dawn Schiller (Kate Bosworth), Holmes 19-year-old girlfriend and from Susan, who sadly doesnt remember anything more than shadows about the night her husbands head was bashed in and hers almost suffered the same fate, and the name of Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian), a major drug kingpin (who is always around ladies such as Barbie (Paris Hilton)), comes into light as a suspect planner of the Wonderland massacre.<br /><br />But what did happen that night? And could Sharon (Lisa Kudrow), Johns wife, know something about it? Wonderland is a taught, intense thriller, a desperate love story and a story of a mans sad decline all in one; there is a clever use of the Rashomon technique (we see the events of that fateful day and night from the eyes of David, John, Dawn, Susan (albeit very briefly) and Sharon), a nice direction and a great script, but is mostly compelling for the performances, especially Kilmers, who takes central stage with his hopeless, tormented, sometimes childish Holmes, Lucas, whose Launius is strangely alluring, Kudrows strong Sharon and Bosworths innocent Dawn.<br /><br />Wonderland: 9/10.|0.498282095265|0.808452380952|0.501717904735

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049223/|Forbidden Planet (1956)|First, this is a review of the two disc set that came together with the Wonderland DVD rental.<br /><br />The two movies included with the rental, Wonderland and the Johnny Wadd documentary, totally obliterate the myth created by Boogie Nights. That myth being that the characters involved in the adult movie trade were considerably more than slimy lowlifes that would do anything for money, basically denying that they were anything other than detestable self-centered whores. This is amazingly similar to what the book Wiseguy and the movie Goodfellas did to The Godfather fable and most of the rest of the gangster romanticism lore.<br /><br />Now, what irritated me most while watching these movies, and will probably irk anyone who saw and liked Boogie Nights, is how foolish and gullible supposedly educated and sophisticated people can be. Dirk Diggler in Boogie Nights is without a doubt John Holmes, who unlike Dirk Diggler, had no redeeming quality. Holmes was a criminal sociopath who abused anyone close to him, was totally consumed by his quest for self-gratification, and was without a doubt a key participant in the brutal murders on Wonderland Avenue in Los Angeles in 1981. The movie lays bare the big lie that Boogie Nights was, and reinforces the Linda Lovelace description of the cruel and pathetic business that is known as the adult film entertainment industry. This should be required viewing, both features on the Wonderland DVD, for anyone who had any positive opinions on the story in the movie Boogie Nights.|0.417084527699|0.32903060846|0.582915472301

This story describes the slow progression of the brothers lives and how their lives separate on two different paths. It is a touching movie narrated by the director, Robert Redford, playing the elderly Norman and reflecting on times long gone and people long dead.<br /><br />Certain themes recur in the movie, such as memory, death, eternity, and dreams. Most of these themes revolve around the almost tragic hero of Paul. He is a capable, charming, and brave man, but has his fatal flaws.<br /><br />The closing lines sum up the point of the movie: Then in the Arctic half-light of the canyon, all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the Big Blackfoot River and a four-count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise. Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the worlds great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time.

This movie has the same texture and look of Panic in Needle Park or Drugstore Cowboy. Hard to believe that human beings can live this type of lifestyle; on the underbelly of society, in which their total existence is based on hardcore drug use, crime, violence, sex, and a total lack of self-respect for anyone or anything, including themselves.<br /><br />Val Kilmore is outstanding in his role of burnt-out former porn star John Holmes. The supporting cast is just as good. However, this is a bleak, dark, disturbing, and depressing film. The murder was brutal, but the daily lives of these people were brutal as well. Unless you have an interest in these murders or were a fan of John Holmes, this really isnt a film to see.

So, finally, it hit the shelves, and I picked it up. Not knowing exactly what to expect, I plopped the dvd in the player, settled in the for an evening of murder, and pressed play. What followed was one of the more engaging flicks Ive seen in the last couple years.<br /><br />*SOME SPOILERS*<br /><br />This is the story of the Wonderland murders, which led to the seediest parts of LA and straight to the biggest porn start of the 70s, John Holmes (Val Kilmer).<br /><br />I was hooked from the beginning, and the feel of the movie held me all the way until the very bloody end. I was surprised to find that the movie focused less on the actual murders and more on the events before and the investigation after. Aside from a few blood splattered walls in the beginning, and the actual showing of the murders towards the end, the movie was more or less an engaging show of great dialoge and great acting. Val Kilmer all but sells me as a junkie porn star, and even the beautiful but thats it Bosworth was a joy to watch (and just for her looks, mind you)<br /><br />I personally felt the best aspect of the movie was, as I mentioned, its lack of outright showing the murders. It was shown in a very dark atmosphere, so you couldnt completely see the brutal bludgeoning bestowed apon the sleeping foursome. Furthermore, the sound effects of said murders were more than enough to whet my appetite. They were being beating with lead pipes, theres not much more that needs to be said.<br /><br />My only real problem was Carrie Fishers brief appearence. Her portrayal of the overly-religious figure was, I think, a bit too cliche of her appearence. Maybe that person was actually part of the story, maybe not, but I wasnt sold, and for some reason, Fisher seemed a bit too akward in her portrayal.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent movie worth the watch, even if once!<br /><br />***8/10***|0.333430212426|0.172984338094|0.666569787574

Boogie Nights is also roughly based on his life. Maybe someday someone is going to do a movie on the life of Tommy Byron instead.<br /><br />The problem is, that the story is not very well told. There are many Law & Order episodes that have more twists and turns than Wonderland, and the director never gets the criminal case going with any kind of gusto. Val Kilmer has two problems - he is not nearly as hung as Holmes is (and no prosthesis this time around, unlike in Boogie Nights), and he is much better looking than mope Holmes. <br /><br />The director does not introduce one single likable individual among the cast. The racist, immature lowlifes he hangs out with, or his wife, and the police dont get much in the way of characterization. <br /><br />The best part of the movie is Eric Bogosian telling Paris Hilton to get lost. <br /><br />Having said all that, anyone interested in the sleaziest side of the porn business in the 1980s or true crime shouldnt miss it.|0.58607523521|0.891100605981|0.41392476479

Some would say this is the tragic tale of America in the excessive eighties where the high of the peace and free love sixties had crashed into drugs and AIDS. Honestly, this is just regular people with no aim in life who sit around getting high and decide to rob a ruthless man. What is the second part of their master plan? Once they have his stuff...theyll sit around and get high again. Great plan. Even if you dont know the story, there is no suspense in this movie and no surprises. The fact that Cox tries to make some kind of folk heroes out of these characters, with party scenes and a montage of their loot, is weak and insulting. The story was better off with a more straight forward approach. As it is, this is just a sad story of small time drug dealers getting killed by big time drug dealers. The bigger story, in more ways than one, is John Holmes. He is the center of this story anyway. This movie should have been all about him, his life.

Nothing compared to Boogie Nights which was kind of slow. Wonderland is a movie which is able to show you a horrible crime story from the perspective from a guy who is just indulged in his drug vice and indolent of what ever happens around.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049223/|Forbidden Planet (1956)|Some films manage to survive almost on originality alone - Wonderland is certainly one of those films. The script manages to throw everything into a near-fever pitch, but without making it incoherent. The speed of this thriller is not to chosen to cover up a weak script, but rather to accurately reflect the drug-addled reality.<br /><br />As director, James Cox as a very peculiar way of working his actors. Most of the characters are perpetually on edge, and often because theyre rather quite ugly personalities. Val Kilmer has described John Holmes to be a hustler, able to manipulate and control. No offense to Kilmer, but his version of Holmes seems only able to control the drastically weak-minded. Nonetheless, its a stunning performance. Comparing this to Kilmers more Hollywood roles like in The Saint it seems to prove he is far more at home in gritty indie flicks.<br /><br />The actors are the main force holding all together. There are various little performances that stand out - especially the women. Carrie Fisher, Kate Bosworth, and Lisa Kudrow all have limited screen time next to their male counterparts, but they are all fantastic. Aside from Kilmer, Ted Levine and Dylan McDermott give a weird, stunning energy to their roles.<br /><br />I originally put off watching Wonderland because I assumed it was a film about a porn actor, in the strictest sense. Yes, the story revolves around John Holmes, but it has literally nothing to do with his professional career. Basically, this film is a murder mystery, and as such - its excellent.<br /><br />RATING: 7.5 out of 10|0.53678935044|0.139984135732|0.46321064956

There is no time wasted on unnecessary crap. And why would it be? There is too much good material here to require dull filler scenes.The cast is good. Kilmer has been mediocre in a string of movies, so here was finally a role quite suitable for him. Bosworth is cute so its irrelevant how she acts (shes solid), and McDermott, who is otherwise quite annoying, is rather good, to a large extent because he is wearing so much facial hair that I didnt recognize him at first. (I wish they did that to Cruise in every movie so I wouldnt have to watch his dumb face.) I utterly failed to recognize Christina Applegate, and wouldnt have known she was in it, had I not seen her name in the end-credits. Kudrow is charming as ever, a bit unusual to see her in a dramatic role. (Btw, Friends is the worst TV sitcom of all time.) The only casting choices that were questionable were an early near-cameo by Carrie Fischer and the totally absurd inclusion of the 90s moron Janeane Garofalo.

The members of the Summer of Love culture, at the end of the seventies and onset of the 80s, were eventually tool old for love beads and all night parties and evolved back into mainstream life, whatever that meant. For those who could not out grow their youthful and sometimes irrational exuberance, theirs was the culture of Wonderland. A love for drugs and a sense of entitlement coupled with a distaste for authority, values and the establishment is the world that the film captures. <br /><br />The sixties were a time of revolution and violent change that tore the American house apart. Once the battles were over, we all had to deal with the aftermath of the carnage. The characters in the Wonderland house are icons of the misfits of the Seventies; part biker, part hippie, part crook, all outcast. No ideology to express, just a sense of dissatisfaction with everything and allegiance to nothing. Ron, Billy and David fancy themselves as some sort of Robin Hoods with dope. They talk of love and behave violently; they take from the rich and sell to the misbegotten; they steal from everyone.<br /><br />Holmes and company are the end result of a strange collision of anti-matter like sex, and drugs and rock & roll, when the lab technicians get bored and move on. <br /><br />The film is skillfully directed and paced and captures the frenetic world of the drug fiends in their element. The fact that Holmes is a porn star is almost irrelevant. That story was told in Boogie Nights. This is a story of a transitional and forgettable era.|0.156436154827|0.846143489125|0.843563845173

I give it a 10, more if possible. The director/ writer and actors did an amazing job. I think teens should watch this movie and will learn from it. It was great, drama, mystery, and more.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049223/|Forbidden Planet (1956)|Embarrassingly, I just watched this movie for the first time, 13 years after its release. Its a story that any father or brother can relate to... one brother is a bit wild, the other brother is the typical older child. Craig Sheffer is a little too unemotional as the oldest brother, but Pitt is amazing, and Skerritt is perfectly cast as the father. The fishing scenes that were filmed in Montana are absolutely breathtaking... I had no idea that fly fishing could be so attractive. The movie closely follows the book, with only a few modifications to make it more appropriate for a movie format. Unlike most book to movie stories, this one measures up. Its a perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a powerful and somewhat emotional movie.|0.168361159055|0.134615066584|0.831638840945
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049223/|Forbidden Planet (1956)|Ive read many negative reviews of this movie and finally got a chance to see it on DVD. To be honest I really dont know what the problem with it is.<br /><br />Its a decent murder mystery thriller, shown from various points of view, from an eccentric cast of often drugged out potential killers/suspects, including the late porn king, John Holmes. Please read the plot synopsis for the exact details of the movies plot - I wish to contribute more to a review than a synopsis.<br /><br />Many reviewers went so far to give this movie their lowest rating due to violence but I really dont see it. MANY modern movies were worse - Saving Private Ryan was ultimately more violent than this movie, which often relies on implied blood stains than actual brutal slayings (the murders depicted in this film were done with lead pipes, afterall).<br /><br />I was enthralled with both halves of the movie - the first showing John Holmes as a hopeless cash hungry drug addict, and the second half showing his side as a minor conspirator in a senseless bloodbath. The movie has excellent acting, even though Dylan McDemorant looks more than a bit out of place in his biker-esque personia and goateeed bad boy personality.<br /><br />The soundtrack was also awesome - a fantastic mix of 70s B-side rock and obscure pop, spread out over a couple of hours in all the right places ala Boogie Nights.|0.415518794354|0.142737374428|0.584481205646

In fact, the entire cast turned in amazing performances in this vastly under-rated movie.<br /><br />As some have mentioned earlier, seek out the two-disc set and watch the Wadd documentary first; it will give you a lot of background on the story which will be helpful in appreciating the movie. <br /><br />Some people seem unhappy about the LAPD crime scene video being included on the DVD. There are a number of reasons that it might have been included, one of which is that John Holmes trial for the murders was the first ever in the United States where such footage was used by the prosecution.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108000/|Ruby in Paradise (1993)|Anarchy and lawlessness reign supreme in the podunk hick hamlet of Elk Hills. The town elders deputize tough, cagey Vietnam veteran Aaron (a wonderfully robust and engaging performance by Kris Kristofferson) and several of his fellow vet buddies to clean up the place. The plan goes sour when Aaron and his cruel cronies decide to take over Elk Hills after they get rid of all the bad elements. Its up to Aarons decent do-gooder brother Ben (amiably played by Jan-Michael Vincent) to put a stop to him before things get too out of hand. Writer/director George (Miami Blues, Gross Pointe Blank) Armitage whips up a delightfully amoral, cynical and wickedly subversive redneck drive-in exploitation contemporary Western winner: he expertly creates a gritty, no-nonsense tone, keeps the pace brisk and unflagging throughout, and stages the plentiful action scenes with considerable muscular aplomb (the rousing explosive climax is especially strong and stirring). The first-rate cast of familiar B-feature faces constitutes as a major asset: Victoria Principal as Bens sweet hottie girlfriend Linda, the fabulous Bernadette Peters as flaky saloon singer Little Dee, Brad Dexter as the feckless mayor, David Doyle as a slimy bank president, Andrew Stevens as an affable gas station attendant, John Carpenter movie regular Charles Cyphers as one of the Nam vets, Anthony Carbone as a smarmy casino manager, John Steadman as a folksy old diner owner, Paul Gleason as a mean strong-arm shakedown bully, and Dick Miller as a talentless piano player. Moral: Dont hire other people to do your dirty work. William Cronjagers slick cinematography, Gerald Frieds lively, harmonic hillbilly bluegrass score, and the abundant raw violence further add to the overall trashy fun of this unjustly neglected little doozy.|0.273292732203|0.645103381798|0.726707267797
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108000/|Ruby in Paradise (1993)|This movie could only originate in the 1970s!! Its a bizarre action movie set in a small California workers town. Some sort of mill or plant is closing down, so suddenly, rampant bad behavior is occurring in the streets! The townsfolks are fed up! So Ben Arnold (Jan Michael Vincent), goes to another town to recruit his brother, Aaron, played by Kris Kristofferson. Aaron is a Vietnam Vet who looks and acts a littleoff balance. He hangs out with a bunch of other surly Vietnam vets. They come into town to clean it up (they become deputized), but underneath their good deeds, they are actually running gambling houses, asking for protection money, etc.!!! It takes a while for people to catch on, and in a biblical Cain and Abel showdown, Vincent has to take on his older brother. Theres an interesting blue-collar sleaze atmosphere to this movie, which makes it interesting (note the cock-fighting scene!). Vincent is almost too angelic in this role  he thinks so highly of his brother, he cannot conceive of him committing the evil deeds hes accused of. He finally comes to his senses  his girlfriend, Victoria Principal, is brutally shot in the back & he himself is beaten up in his home. Kris Kristofferson is creepily effective as Aaron. He coolly denies any wrong-doing, and even gently coos and talks to Vincents young daughter (she refers to him as Uncle Aaron) even while hes threatening her fathers life, all the while smiling! Vincent and Kristofferson have good contrasting chemistry with each other. Bernadette Peters makes an interesting appearance as a saloon girl who attracts Aarons attention. This is a good 70s action movie, if you can find it!! It is NOT available on DVD yet|0.581564697211|0.831913348568|0.418435302789

It not only features a great cast but is also loaded with wild shootouts and explosions that are still impressive today. The story is about a Vietnam vet (Kris Kristofferson) being recruited by his brother (Jan-Michael Vincent) to help clean up the criminal element in a small town and what happens when Kris starts taking advantage of his position and becomes as bad as the criminals he was hired to get rid of. Its great seeing Kris play against type. Bernadette Peeters and Victoria Principal both offer great support as the respective ladies of the two male stars. Jan-Michael shows real movie star persona in this film. I dont think Vigilante Force is on video but it occasionally shows up on TV.

It was like being at the old Drive-In Theater again! You could tell the guy who made this movie liked all the horrible dubbed zombie movies. This one has all the cliches and tricks from those films rolled into one, and its neat because it is SUPPOSE to be like that. The cheeze factor is high, the gore flows and the laughs roll! The effects go from sloppy to good, with the one where the guy gets torn in half and the one where a guy gets his heart shoved through his chest both being excellent! The acting goes from terrible to actually pretty good. There is not much plot, just lots and lots of gore. This one is patterned after the zombie movies from Italy and Spain I think, because they linger on the gross scenes forever, like this movie. If you like Troma movies, cheezy B-grade stuff, then you can do no wrong watching this one. A nice way to waste a Friday night!|0.821150634583|0.163536335032|0.178849365417

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108000/|Ruby in Paradise (1993)|I originally reviewed this film on Amazon about 6 or 7 years ago, and blasted it. I believe I called it wretched and a turkey. Okay, well, by most standards, its still a turkey. Its got almost no production values, what little plot there is makes almost no sense, and the acting is on the level of a third-grade play. That said, this has really grown on me over the years as a sort of camp classic. In fact, all of director Todd Sheets films have had this effect. Theyre almost like Ed Wood in that regard: Watch them over and over and pick out the flubbed lines, continuity errors (same zombie, two different locations!), and other flaws.<br /><br />Ill say this: Sheets is a very nice guy, and while this, one of his first productions, isnt that great, he has gotten better. And I must add that the only really decent actor/actress in the film is Kasey Rousch, though I may be biased, as I attended school with her.|0.500808883136|0.140625030263|0.499191116864
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108000/|Ruby in Paradise (1993)|A meltdown at a nuclear power plant causes a majority of people to turn into lethal, rot-faced, shambling zombies who naturally go on a grisly rampage. A ragtag handful of uninfected folks do their best to survive this grueling ordeal. Director/co-writer/producer Todd Sheets displays an appealingly sincere love and passion for go-straight-for-the-throat lively and gruesome horror fare: he maintains an unflagging snappy pace throughout, fills the screen with wall-to-wall crazy action, and thankfully keeps the terrible dialogue to a pleasing minimum. Moreover, Sheets certainly doesnt skimp on the gloriously graphic and excessive over-the-top splatter: this picture delivers a tasty truckload of flesh melting, evisceration, lots of gut munching, one dude has his heart yanked out, and theres even a nice impalement on a tree branch. Sheets earns bonus points for keeping the tone grim and nasty to the literal bitter end (for example, almost all of the main characters wind up becoming zombie chow). Granted, this flick has its fair share of flaws: the ragged editing, several ham-fisted attempts at pathos, and the largely awful acting from a rank no-name cast all leave a good deal to be desired. Top thespic honors go to the pretty and perky Kasey Rausch for her winningly spunky portrayal of the resourceful Daria Trumillio. Frank Dunlay likewise does well as rugged take-charge army veteran Ralph Walsh. Best of all, Sheets sure grasp of an infectiously slambang sense of unrelenting headlong momentum and obvious affinity for the horror genre ensure that this remains a total blast to watch from start to finish.|0.167552835426|0.11123060225|0.832447164574

Of all the Marvel superhero games that have been so lame with weak graphics and gameplay, Spiderman improves in both departments. It also features the voice of Stan Lee, the creator of Spiderman comics.<br /><br />As youd expect Spiderman does whatever a spider can. He does more than spin webs. In fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. When hes not using web in combat, he punches and kicks as well. Spidey has his hands full as he battles Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion, and Dr. Octopus to name a few. Look for Captain America in a cameo.<br /><br />Most of the levels are challenging, but some of them require patience to beat. The only complaint about this game is that its so short and can be completed in less than three hours. If youre a real Marvel superhero fan, this game is for you but dont expect long gameplay.

Its one of the few that try to deal with the second sad side of the war: The time after. Different from movies like Taxi driver or Rambo which use to present their main characters as broken heroes in a bad after war environment this movie allows the audience to face a different view on the Vietnam vets. Their development is shown very precisely before and especially after the war. The problems are obvious but in all this tragic there is always the feeling of some hope on the basis of love and friendship. Jacknife might be the quietest Vietnam movie ever but after almost 15 years this is really plausible and therefor justified. Moreover, it can make us believe that the war has not finished, yet; at least for some of us.<br /><br />The three main characters are amazing.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106834/|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993)|I did not like the pretentious and overrated Apocalypse Now. Probably my favorite Vietnam War film is The Deer Hunter. The Deer Hunter focused on one part of the war, and then focused on the lives before the war. This movie is essentially Deer Hunter 2. The script is too loose compared to the Deer Hunter. The story is never developed to the point that the audience can truly understand and feel for the characters like the Deerhunter did. The Vietnam flashbacks are not as gripping or involved as the ones in the Deerhunter. This is why I can only give this movie 7 out of 10.<br /><br />However, I think that the acting was outstanding. DeNiro and Harris are truly amazing actors. They totally immersed themselves in their characters and expressed the great anguish of two former friends who lost their best friend Bobby in combat. Harris character is a half-dead alcoholic, who hides the guilt that he has in Bobby losing his life trying to save his.<br /><br />I also like the supporting cast. Everyone in the town is part of the movie. The town obviously cant handle Vietnam vets very well. Like many small towns, it is all about being quiet, humble, and minding ones business. Harris character, however, cant be any of these things. It is interesting how wars effect people.

That country, which wasnt even in North America, was made the 49th state... (of course, there were only 48 states at the time, since this was made in 1952...) Linda travels to the country she has inherited, and we follow her along as she tries to figure out what to do with this strange country and its even quirkier people. At one point, she sings a song that she claims is from her people the Navajo, and it gets ever-more sillier from there.... although Yolande Donlans heavy lipstick and omni-present smile never get ruffled or shmeared. There are other songs scattered through-out as the citizens sing to welcome their new princess. Filmed in a glorious British version of technicolor, or some such equivalent, about the only big name here is Dirk Bogarde as British subject Tony Craig, cheese vendor. Bogarde made a big splash in the UK film industry after serving in the war, and was even knighted by QE II. Craig and the new princess keep bumping into each other, and their adventures become more intertwined as Lampidorras financial problems worsen... Fun little farce....along the lines of Marx Brothers film. Also note that Donlan later married Val Guest, the writer and director of our little project, and stayed married for 50 years!

Abhay and Ritika (played by Fardeen Khan & Esha Deol respectively) meet at a friends wedding where their own marriage (unbeknowst to them) begins its process of being arranged. Within no time the two strangers are married and sent of to a honeymoon camp where they meet other couples going through the motions similar to theirs. As they spend time together, secrets are revealed, hearts broken and/or mended and love blossoms.<br /><br />If youve seen Honeymoon Private Limited and/or Salaam-e-Ishq, then youve seen this film. The plot twists are the same, there is not a single element of surprise in the entire two and a half hours of the film. Everything is predictable. I only enjoyed it because I had seen Darling (also starring the leads Deol & Khan) earlier in the day and enjoyed their chemistry in that so I said why not when my sister suggested we rent Just married as well.<br /><br />See it: Because Kirron Kher co-stars and is her usual darling self in it.<br /><br />Skip it: Because youve had enough of all this couple-fest nonsense! <br /><br />C+|0.560416645941|0.150911288972|0.439583354059
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107131/|Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey (1993)|As a Westerner watching another cultures view and tradition of marriag, I found Just Married mesmerizing and delightful. The idea of marrying a stranger through the mutual arrangement of parents is difficult, especially in this modern age. Yet this is the case in this Hindi film. Told with humor, and fresh perspective, we learn of Abhay and Ritika who have only met once and are now on their traditional five day honeymoon. As said, it is difficult to believe in this cell phone affluent age that such an archaic custom as an arranged marriage still take place. We see the awkwardness that this young couple feels as they come together on their first night, and how they try to forge a bond, even though they do not know one another. We see different views of marriage and commitment as presented by the other couples also on holiday, from a couple of forty years married to others still unsure of making marital commitment. Theres song, witty dialog, poignant moments, blending and comparison of new ways and tradition. Watching the movie with subtitles definitely loses some of the trueness of the story, yet it is still a delight to watch. Granted some of the plot is a little trite and the bus incident a bit drawn out and contrived; however the overall movie was worth watching.|0.133019501494|0.332721901973|0.866980498506

Very nicely done. Songs are OK too. I think the writer director is great. The movie shows how marriages progress thru time. They have couples at different stages of life and relationships in their life the film beautifully depicts quite a few stages in parallel in the same story. Some of the dialogs are quite good. The movie depicts complex human emotion very nicely not with over dramatization. Also shows perfect is after all not so perfect. Shows very nicely the dynamics of arranged marriage when it is new.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107131/|Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey (1993)|I was waiting to see this movie from a long time. Its promos gave a fair idea about the content and when I finally saw it, I really find it was quite well made. Most of the conventional romantic movies end with the lovers finally getting married or start of with a happy life after marriage but there is really a great adjustment needed for this transition from an old life to a new relation and life. This is what this movie is all about the period when a newly wed couple Fardeen and Esha get married through an arranged marriage and start off their life with their honeymoon. The acting is really spell binding though I think Esha remained a bit quiet and she could have used some lines for herself. The story was well knitted and dialogs were more or less appropriate. The editing and direction were also good, Meghna Gulzar really did a good job here. To summarize I would say it is a good drama cum romance, a true combination of what Bollywood can offer a clean entertainer.|0.324536453733|0.145182589227|0.675463546267

So is Uttara Baokar who is usually excellent in most of her roles. Along with Kairee, its an example of Marathi cinema at its best. There are certain parts in both movies that tend to the didactic - it would have probably enhanced the movie to not have the few scenes where the social message is hammered in. These scenes probably emerge from the film-makers political concerns but the movie is realistic and moving enough to not need it. But apart from such minor quibbles, its a movie that deserves to be seen more and one I strongly recommend.

Sonali Kulkarni winning the National Award is perhaps the only consoling fact. Renuka Daftardar simply amazes as she speaks volumes through her eyes. There are a few scenes that stand out: When Gauri comes back from the city on Krishnas wedding, she and Krishna meet for the first time in many years. Krishna notices a change in Gauri, but not a single line of dialogue is said. The entire gamut of emotions is conveyed through subtle mannerisms and the eyes. Theres another towards the end when Krishna pleads to Abhay Kulkarni to marry Gauri instead.

I recommend this to anyone who likes cult classics. Also try Fritz the cat and the NINE Lives of Fritz the Cat. If Im correct Ralph Bashki did that movie too.It involves a cat that goes through hard times with family, streets,jobs , etc. When I was old enough I rented all of these movies out. Because Coonskin was an offensive title during that era it was also labeled as Street Fighter. Ralph Bashki also made Cool World starring a very young Brad Pitt.

With Scatman (RIP) and the love walrus (also RIP) being black and the main point of view, I saw it as an attack on racism mostly. The fact that Richard Pryor liked it says as much as well.

Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:18A<br /><br />I saw Coonskin today.This film is also known as Bustin Out and Street Fight.After watching Fritz The Cat,I wanted to see more of Bashkis films.I saw Cool World and thought it was mediocre and I saw this.When it was first released, the film was very controversial.It was considered racist and Al Sharpton wanted the film banned, he even led protests outside the theatre where the film was playing.The film was only released on VHS under the title Street Fight.It is now considered a cult-classic film and African-American celebrities such as comedian Richard Pryor,director Spike Lee and the rap group The Wu-Tang Clan are said to have enjoyed this film.I personally thought Fritz The Cat was a much better film but this is very enjoyable as well.Worth watching for Bashki or Blaxploitation film fans.The film mixes live action and animation sort of like the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit.I would have preferred it in full animation but whatever.The film starts off with a reverend and another man racing to rescue two of their friends from prison.While the prisoners wait,the older one tells a story of three men he knew.The film then switches into animation format, we see three black men who sold their house to this man.They decide to make names for themselves in Harlem.So the leader, a black rabbit, kills a big player in Harlem and he basically becomes a big shot.The film moves on as the Italian mafia want him out.The mafia involves the godfather,his three sons who are homosexual and an Italian clown.Coonskin is an entertaining animated film thats worth checking out, if you can find it.|0.255671264424|0.861145069484|0.744328735576
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107131/|Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey (1993)|I had watched this film from Ralph Bakshi (Wizards, Hey Good Lookin), one night ago on www.afrovideo.org, and I didnt see anything racial (I am not stupid), I do admit the character designs are a bit crude and unaccpectable today, but I think its a satire and a very,very urban retelling of the old Uncle Remus stories that the Black American culture, created right down to the main characters and the blatant nod to The Tar Baby and The Briar Patch. These arent bigoted stories, mind you, but cultural icons created by Black Americans, and me being a white woman read and love those stories. And I also found it an interesting time-capsule view on the black culture in Harlem, New York in the 70s.<br /><br />Well to get to the nitty-gritty of this film: This film is a live-action/animated film, which begins in live-action with a fellow named Sampson (Barry White) and the Preacherman (Charles Gordone) rush to help their friend, Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) escape from prison, but are stopped by a roadblock and wind up in a shootout with the police. While waiting for them, Randy unwillingly listens to fellow escapee Pappy (Scatman Crothers), as he begins to tell Randy the animated story of Brother Rabbit, a young newcomer to the big city who quickly rises from obscurity to rule over all of Harlem; you know, to me Rabbit,Bear and Fox are animal versions of Randy,Sampson and the Preacherman. An abstract juxtaposition of stylized animation and live action footage, the film is a graphic and condemnatory satire of stereotypes prevalent in the 70s  racial, ethnic, and otherwise.<br /><br />So anyway, it is another GOOD Bakshi movie; and should we sweep films like this under the rug? pretend they never exist? hmmm...I think that would be a shame; I think we should watch these films entacted, and learn about what goes on back then, just how far we come since then.|0.289278108857|0.859494681211|0.710721891143
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107131/|Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey (1993)|Streetfight (aka Coonskin) is a very unique film directed by animation pioneer Ralph Bakshi. It is an oddity of the cinema, and is very much worth seeing. It is live action mixed with animation, seemingly influenced on Disneys legendary Song of the South, almost as if it is a response to that flick. Philip Michael Thomas, later to become Don Johnsons sidekick on Miami Vice, and Scatman Crothers, most famous for his role in Kubricks The Shining, are prison escapees. Charles Gordone and Barry White (yes, that Barry White) are Thomas friends and plan to help him escape prison. They are stuck at a police roadblock, and Crothers tells Thomas a story about a black rabbit, a bear, and a fox who move from the South to Harlem in order to find a more peaceful existence. The story is animated, and provides a lot of wonderous things to see. Like all of Bakshis films, most will be annoyed and will dislike the animation. True animation lovers will forgive its clunkiness and fall in love with its inventiveness. The movie is very violent, very sexual, and it is mostly about battles between the races. For a long time, I thought I was watching something extremely important, but after a while, especially after I got done watching it, it started to seem more like a run-of-the-mill blacksploitation flick, along the lines of Superfly. Its very sloppy and doesnt really say anything. Besides, isnt Bakshi white? Whatever the answer to that, Coonskin/Streetfight is still very much worth watching for animation aficionados as well as cult movie fans. 7/10.|0.252378174626|0.224725625737|0.747621825374

He wrote it in collaboration with Scat Man Crothers and Barry White, who appear in the film as well. The racist imagery can often be disturbing, but the message of the movie was so powerful that the NAACP gave it an endorsement (but only grudgingly).<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in an examination of the pervading atmosphere of racism that Bakshi attempts to deconstruct.

Deciding that he would like to make just one more perfect run, he breaks out of the hospital, steals back Eleanor, and hooks up with old friend Penelope Pearson (Eileen Brennan), who is in need of relocating her troupe of prostitutes.<br /><br />Fondas wonderful performance is a natural anchor for a film that tugs at the heartstrings as effectively as it tickles the funny bone in the more comedic scenes. A superb cast including Robert Englund, as a reluctant young sidekick, Susan Sarandon (who also gets co-producer credit), and Dub Taylor (a delightful ham, as always, in the most blatantly comedic portion of the picture) helps immeasurably.<br /><br />The ultimately life-affirming nature of the picture and the poignancy of the journey carry incredible weight; this is a picture, that provided you get into it, you can remember long after its over.<br /><br />The promise of the open road is vividly displayed here; the countryside just looks beautiful. Set to Craig Safans wonderful music score, its a remarkable picture in terms of aesthetics.<br /><br />It loses a little something in its final act (the characters played by John Byner and Austin Pendleton are little more than intrusions), but it still maintains its good vibes thanks to the appeal of its central characters.<br /><br />Not at all the exploitation / drive-in schlock picture one might expect from the title (especially its alternate title, The Great Smokey Roadblock), its a rewarding movie experience that I can recommend without qualms.<br /><br />9/10|0.0822201727481|0.729279443183|0.917779827252

Personally Im one of those people who loves cats so that would have been a big down side to the movie, but I loved it how cats from every were got their revenge at the end.<br /><br />I liked the movie, but I have to admit it was because I found Brian Krause who played Charles Brady very very irresistible, I guess lust got the better of me while watching this movie.<br /><br />There was one thing that I was disappointed over. Ive watched Charmed before and Brian Krause is married to Holly Marie Combs, his kissing scene was O.K. in Sleepwalkers, but really bad compare to his kissing scenes with Holly Marie Combs, I dont know if it is because Krause and Combs have great chemistry or maybe more it a bit more, that was the only disappointment in the movie but I guess it was made up for with Brian Krause in those tight ass jeans he was wearing in the movie.<br /><br />If you are use to seeing Brian Krause as Holly Marie Combs heavenly husband and the father of her son your in for a big surprise with this movie, he was nothing like angle boy. Although now that I think about it, it would be great to see Krauses character on Charmed taken over by evil making him something like his was in Sleepwalkers.<br /><br />I also have to say the music was GREAT in this movie too!|0.57608390256|0.147935051473|0.42391609744

Some years ago I saw another movie, called: *Andy Colbys Incredible Adventure* In this movie were parts of *Wizards of the lost kingdom* used in. They called this movie KOR the conquerer. I began to search for the KOR-Movie many years, because I wanted to see the complete movie, not only the parts which were used in the *Andy Colby*-Movie. No shop had this Kor-Movie to rent and no shop did know this movie. Many years I watched my old VHS-tapes I had at home, and what a wonder... I had this movie since many years still at home, but the movie had a different title, because in Germany it has 3 or 4 titles. So I was happy to find this tape at home and this time I had much more time in watching *KOR the Conquerer again. The music is great during the hole movie, but the best part of filming in combination with the music is this moment, when KOR is walking drunken through the green forrest. The music in the background had some kind of magic. I like Bo Svenson, and also the boy, who played Simon in the movie. Both of them did their job very good. Manfred Kraatz, Germany, 26.10.2004.

Watch out for the insanely obvious seams and zip on the monsters costume, the fact that the hero looks a lot like Keith Chegwin and such classic lines as the following: Evil Wizard-Type Bloke: At last we meet Kor... Kor: Thrilling, isnt it?<br /><br />Amazing!!I also like the fact that although the video box looks quite exciting with images of a castle surrounded by raging seas and a dangerous falcon-like bird carrying a handsome hero to safety (among other such interesting and engaging suggestions of what goes on in the actual film, none of them actually happen. No, Im not joking...there really isnt a raging sea or a ferocious bird, its just trying to make you interested...classic in my opinion.

This movie made me happier than Ive been for a while.<br /><br />It is a very funny and clever movie. The running joke of the kingdoms history of prince savagery and the aftermath, the way indulging in magic effects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled.

Kenneth Brannagh on the other hand was brilliant. His scheming was wonderful as was his toying with the audience. Very nice work.<br /><br />There were at times too little drama where more would have been expected. Cassios slaying, for instance, was a bit clouded by too much happening to far apart, causing the spectator to twist his head to grasp it all.<br /><br />Did I mention Michael Maloney?

If you love Kenneth Branaghs magnificent masterpieces Much ado about nothing (1993) and Hamlet (1996) as much as I do Im dead certain youll also find Oliver Parkers Othello irresistible. Laurence Fishburne has been in a various splendid roles during his career. He was quite terrific in Boys n the hood (1991) - Ive always considered his amusing role of Furious Styles as his very greatest achievement. That was, of course, way before I saw this.<br /><br />He plays the part of Othello and he is probably in the most challenging role of his whole career but he does a brilliant, fantastic job. Irène Jacob is absolutely charming Desdemona and Kenneth Branagh is just simply phenomenal in a most fascinating role of the storys crooked, manipulate villain Iago. Marvelous Othello is part of the absolute elite among Shakespeares ingenious works. It deals with his favorite topics: crookedness, envy, deceitfulness and jealousy. This movie adaptation is certainly one of the finest films Ive seen thats based on William Shakespeares plays.|0.077927722833|0.0933619245628|0.922072277167
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106880/|Fear of a Black Hat (1993)|Branagh and Fishburne deliver excellent performances in this version of the Shakespeare classic. Branagh plays Iago better than Ive seen the character played in film or on stage. Some might say this film is overly Iago-centric, but I disagree. Fishburne, the first black Othello in film history ironically, delivers a powerful performance. Fishburne has always been a good actor, but this performance as the Moor of Venice may be one of his best. <br /><br />The one problem I have with this film, is the simple subtraction of a number of important scenes. Desdemonas character is given far less depth than she has in the play. In this film, she might as well not be added at all. One of the worst cuts made by Branagh in this film, was the subtraction of a conversation between Iago and Desdemona at the beginning of the second act. This part of the play shows that Desdemona may not be the innocent child she is portrayed as in this film. There were a number of subtractions that hurt the integrity of this film. <br /><br />However, if you have not read the play, or seen a film version of Othello before, I recommend this movie. The story, cut or not, is still incredibly enthralling. The acting, as stated previously, is very good. If some important scenes had been added, and Desdemonas character been prioritized a bit further, this would be a great movie. As it stands, its still an admirable version of the original. I give it a marginal recommendation.|0.0990636024405|0.139092970522|0.90093639756
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106880/|Fear of a Black Hat (1993)|My college professor says that Othello may be Shakespeares finest drama. I dont know if I agree with him yet. I bought this video version of the film. First I love Kenneth BRanagh as Iago, he was perfectly complicated and worked very well in this adaptation. SUrprisingly, he didnt direct it but played a role. Lawrence Fishburne shows that American actors can play Shakespeare just as well as British actors can do. not that there was a British vs. American issue about it. In fact, if we all work together then Shakespeare can reach the masses which it richly deserves to do. Apart from other Shakespeare tragedies, this is dealt with the issue of race. Something that has existed since the beginning of time. The relationship between Iago and Emilia could have been better and shown the complicatedness of their union together. While Othello loves Desdemona with all his heart, he is weak for jealousy and fears losing her to a non-Moorish man like Cassio. Its quite a great scene at the end of the film but I wont reveal the ending. ITs just worth watching.

This Irishman, always brilliant, cleanly steals the show away. Olivier recognized that potential in his production, and cast Iago with someone he knew he could upstage. I didnt nearly realize the possibilities of Iago, Shakespeares most evil character, but Branagh shows us the depths. Nice to see the views of Venice, too.|0.287903013755|0.39521640981|0.712096986245

Perhaps this explains why his acting, in this beautifully edited film, comes over as so believable and so powerful. Instead of chewing the scenery in the approved fashion for such high-powered roles, Fishburnes portrayal is focused more on Othellos love for his wife, and on his profound sadness at her supposed betrayal, than on violence and vengeance. In a word, the performance is understated, and made far more impressive by Fishburnes extremely intelligent interpretation than it otherwise would have been.<br /><br />The acting throughout is superb, and the (abridged) speeches gain grace from their light editing.

The cast played very well, too, and I liked the script following Shakespeares original text so faithfully. But I must say some scenes were acted too erotically for such a character as Desdemona. I have always thought she is very modest, and thats why it is not proper at all to show her in bed with Cassio - although it was happening only in Othellos imagination. At first, I was a little surprised even that a love scene between Othello and Desdemona was shown so openly.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106880/|Fear of a Black Hat (1993)|Othello, the classic Shakespearen story of love, betrayal, lies, and tragedy. I remember studying this story in high school, actually I found Othello to be probably my favorite Shakespeare story due to the fact of how fascinating it was, the fact that Shakespeare captured the feeling of friendship, love, and racism perfectly. I mean, when you really do study this story, you could go into so many philosophies on why Othello went insane with jealousy in the blink of an eye. But later on for my report I also watched this version of Othello and I have to say that it was absolutely brilliant. Lawerance and Kenneth just capture the story so well and understood its darkness.<br /><br />Othello is the big time soldier in his city, he is loved by everyone, including the king. But when the king finds out that Othello snuck off with his daughter, Desdemona, the king is infuriated, but excepts it. Othello is welcome in the city and makes his best friend, Cassio, his side man instead of Iago, who has stood by Othello. Due to his insane jealousy, hes out for revenge. Still pretending to be Othellos best friend, he just mearly hints at Othello that Desdemona is cheating on him with Cassio, never says that they are, just makes Othello think that its happening. Othello is driven insane and doesnt have pleasant plans for Desdemona or Cassio and Iago is more than happy to help him out.<br /><br />Othello is an incredible story, I highly recommend that you read it. Its an incredible story that keeps you thinking after youve read it. Othello the movie is also great and once again I recommend it, it captured the story perfectly and has a big tearjerker type of feel, or you could just be in utter shock of what happens between Othello and Desdemona, how quickly he believes that his true love would betray him. This is a terrific movie, great acting, good sets, and good direction, this is what Shakespeare meant when he wrote the story.<br /><br />10/10|0.0975245932243|0.703919794165|0.902475406776
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106880/|Fear of a Black Hat (1993)|You do not get more dark or tragic than Othello and this movie captures the play fairly well, with outstanding performances by Lawrence Fishburne and Irene Jacob. Fishburnes expresses to the viewer Othellos torment as he falls prey to Iagos lies very convincingly, even providing a realistic epileptic episode. Jacob is the loving and loyal wife who becomes either the instrument of Iagos revenge against Othello, or the object of his wrath (it is not clear which since no motive for Iagos behavior is offered). Although Kenneth Brannagh (sp?) displays his usual talent for Shakespeare in this movie, he is somewhat marginalized. The characters of Cassio and Emilia also wander in and out of scenes even though they, like Iago, seem more crucial to the plot. I have not checked the movie against the play to see how many lines were cut out, but I know that Shakespeare tends to develop his characters, even the seemingly unimportant ones, very well.<br /><br />If I had any criticism of the movie it would be that the story unfolds too quickly, and that the relationships between some of the characters are not laid out more. The director had a great cast, and no one offered a bad performance. The relationship between Cassio and Othello and that between Emilia and Desdemona need to be further developed earlier in the film. I have a feeling that they were closer to each other than the movie suggests, although you get a sense of this very late into the movie. Also, Othello and Desdemona need more time together. Although their anguish is convincing, the amount of interaction they have with each other makes it seem like they just met. On the other hand, maybe the did just meet---like Romeo and Juliet.<br /><br />In brief: good performances, too short.<br /><br />|0.431453226492|0.145060837966|0.568546773508
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106880/|Fear of a Black Hat (1993)|Ive always enjoyed Kenneth Branaghs versions of the Shakespeare classics, as he always does a very good job, but in this movie, the one who lifts the whole movie, is none other than the-always-great-actor Laurence Fishburne. Surely he has made some poor choices in films, even though hes a wonderful actor, but in this one were truly given the real Othello: the passion, the intensity of jealousy as it grows stronger alongside with Fishburnes well portrayed paranoia and, furthermore, were finally given a black Othello!<br /><br />I dont think they could have chosen a better Othello. Who else could have given him that blend of sympathy/antipathy, love/hatred and, not to forget, those fiery eyes...? Branagh is good as always, but not at his peak, Iréne Jacobs Desdemona is fairly good but a bit bleak, whilst Laurence Fishburne truly lifts it and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable movie.

A kingdom whose king is about to die has said king unleash a competition on his several sons to see who can retrieve a ruby first to be king whilst a trio of witches want the star to carve up and use to keep them young. These three plot threads weave intricately together throughout the entire picture blended with good acting, dazzling special effects, and some solid sentiment and humour as well. Stardust is a fun film and has some fun performances from the likes of Claire Danes as the star(I could gaze at her for quite some time) to Michelle Pfeiffer(I could gaze at her at full magical powers even longer) playing the horrible witch to Robert Deniro playing a nancy-boy air pirate to perfection. Charlie Cox as the lead Tristan is affable and credible and we get some very good work from a group of guys playing the sons out to be king who are constantly and consistently trying to kill off each other. Mark Strong, Jason Flemyng, and Ruppert Everett plays their roles well in both life and death(loved this whole thread as well). Peter OToole plays the dying killer daddy and watch for funny man Ricky Gervais who made me laugh more than anything in the entire film in his brief five minutes(nice feet).

OK so hes doing diane arbus meets. . . whatever. . . but it wasnt long before I realized that this wasnt being done in a dehumanizing way, as the images unfold I felt that the problem was entirely the audiences: we are conditioned by Hollywood and also movies from just about everywhere actually to feel that to watch people above a certain age behave in a sexual way is something unseemly, something that ought not to be shown. if this were all the film offered it would be a great deal. however, the story of the woman with the abusive boyfriend and his drunk friend really hits like a ton of bricks: very eloquent storytelling, incredible performances, and to think the scene was improvised. that blonde guy is a genius actor. finally I want to contradict those who say this film is all about how pathetic all these people are. the old man who is on the make with the woman who finally dances for him is completely an a OK character that breaks that mold, so dont oversimplify the film by overlooking him. yes his dog gets killed. this aint a rosy picture of the world but its not . . . completely hopeless. anyway I felt really grateful to the filmmaker for making such a beautiful film all in all. I wouldnt say each of the threads were as strong as the strongest, but I say this movie basically kicks ass and would highly recommend it. . .|0.361082179629|0.137917158263|0.638917820371
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110099/|I.Q. (1994)|I agree with the previous comment in naming the films content everyday madness but would like to specify that: Dog Days is about how women are treated in (a male) society. The episodes we get to see here show some variation in everyday discrimination of women, mostly categorized by age group. There is a senior man who makes his new partner look and act the way his late wife had, treating her like a doll that shall act worthy of wearing the formers dress. There is a middle-aged couple in whose relationship she is nearly a slave and he a (violent) master. Further we find a somewhat younger man who does not communicate with his friend/wife and instead of being really jealous about her affairs even makes friendship with his competitor(s). A young adult man makes clear to his friend - a girl who is really troubled by being pretty enough for him - that she has to be the jewelry at his side and to follow his narrow viewed rules of etiquette. Finally there is a man in his late fifties who calculating his own advantage delivers a simple-minded hitchhiking woman to a furious client who - taking her for guilty in having scratched his car - natural beats her up. To complete the examples we find the pal of the man in the master-slave-couple - after collectively abusing her - threatening and humiliating the former in her sake for she shall get rid of her partner and take himself as her new master. During all this the inhabitants of the lately built neighborhood in which the action takes place rests under the burning summer-sun - absolutely motionless (sic!). Unfortunately I have not seen the last minutes of this shocking and authentic portray of the archaic structures that still reign in the relationship between women and men, but what I have seen convincingly analyzed the repertoire of discrimination. Probably a helpful tool in teaching even the less sensitive spectator what goes wrong - due to good visualization.|0.377369732115|0.817474054658|0.622630267885

Some of the acting is extraordinary, see Maria Hofstätter for instance. The director has tried to depict life as realistically as possible, succeeding. Coherently, the sex scenes are explicit and no more fake than those of a hard-core movie. Although I hardly understood a sentence, I found the vision of the movie in the original language with subtitles much more rewarding, because with the dubbing half the great work of the actors gets lost. The voice of the character played by Maria Hofstätter is particularly hard to duplicate by a dubber.<br /><br />My favorite movie|0.512186607583|0.0902777810291|0.487813392417

I guess Hundstage is such a movie.<br /><br />You see the lowest level of Austrias society, dirty, disturbed, weird, hateful. But they still have enough money so they can afford tuned cars and big houses. And they are definitely doing a lot of strange things here which maybe seems for them normal because theyre doing it through their whole life. From a normal human viewpoint you can now easily follow the movie and be disgusted or fascinated and watch a fine piece of Austrias art movies.<br /><br />But if you LIVE here and you know the people you see the characters in Hundstage as the tumor of the society. A society that is going more insane from day to day, creating their own rules that nobody else can understand, cave the social system from within. And you SEE the people. Sitting in the park, standing at the opposite street corner, queuing in the same line. Maybe you meet em in a bar or a disco you may visit. Maybe you even work with them in your job or they are living next to your house. You start to hate them without exactly knowing why. Youll try to get away - but you cannot. Maybe youll end up like them. But it seems normal for you because youre doing it through your whole life now...<br /><br />Life isnt so bright though Austria is one of the richest countries in the world. It has beautiful people... but some are also ugly. There are a lot of hard working persons trying their best... but there are also some riding on the back of others and destroying everything that the folk of Austria has built up so far.<br /><br />A very pessimistic movie.|0.151771678435|0.160607478362|0.848228321565

(1994)|Its not a brilliant idea to watch Hundstage if youre not 100% sure of your mental stability, because it will be severely tested with this film no matter how sane you are. I have to say Hundstage is an art film rather than an entertainment film, so the majority of the viewers wouldnt have the level of maturity to reach in to its delightful side. Kind of like Tarkovsky films, but different in a way. I, myself, cant say I had a lot of fun watching it. But its an outstanding and very interesting experience for those who are only tormented by the cliché that Hollywood offers. Hundstage sticks a finger right into your brain and scratches your mind all over. You cant simply sit back and watch it, youll be using exclamations or looking with eyes wide open throughout the film. A film thats similar to this in style is Nachtgestalten, but it was considerably better, and way less violent. This one for instance, is not for children or those who are mentally tender or bad-tempered. Most viewers would most likely give either a 10 or a 1 to this film. I give it a 9 because Ive seen the multiple-stories-in-one-film phenomenon in another film and it was better. But this ones an outstanding piece on its own.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110099/|I.Q. (1994)|Trailers of this movie may show scenes of violence or non mainstream sexuality, but these scenes are just rare fragments, picked out to attract audience. They are, of course showing the main message of the movie:<br /><br />People who are constantly kicked on their heads in their jobs and lives, using power, which they may have somewhere else, to notoriously oppress others. And at the low end of the oppression chain, mostly women.<br /><br />A movie showing this as brutally as Hundstage is surely tough to face, but having to endure such lives, is even tougher.<br /><br />Technically the film is much like Short Cuts, but consisting of documentary style episodes, featuring people like your neighbour, playing just the way they are. Without any glitter, and most disturbingly, without any hope. Its documentary style makes the movie even more disturbing, because you realize, such people are out there, and there are many of them, although our society focuses on the nice exterior looks. Somewhere the porn industry has to do its business, somewhere unreported domestic violence has to take place, somewhere hopes have to shatter. I sure do know such people.<br /><br />If you want to see a movie without any funny scenes (some may think the handicapped woman repeating the top ten supermarkets is funny, but this happens for real) and without any melodramatic, go watch this movie. However it will lose when you are focusing on subtitles I fear, as subtitles can´t transport accentuation.|0.371053826091|0.224509730879|0.628946173909
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110099/|I.Q. (1994)|Being an Austrian myself this has been a straight knock in my face. Fortunately I dont live nowhere near the place where this movie takes place but unfortunately it portrays everything that the rest of Austria hates about Viennese people (or people close to that region). And it is very easy to read that this is exactly the directors intention: to let your head sink into your hands and say Oh my god, how can THAT be possible!. No, not with me, the (in my opinion) totally exaggerated uncensored swinger club scene is not necessary, I watch porn, sure, but in this context I was rather disgusted than put in the right context.<br /><br />This movie tells a story about how misled people who suffer from lack of education or bad company try to survive and live in a world of redundancy and boring horizons. A girl who is treated like a whore by her super-jealous boyfriend (and still keeps coming back), a female teacher who discovers her masochism by putting the life of her super-cruel lover on the line, an old couple who has an almost mathematical daily cycle (she is the official replacement of his ex wife), a couple that has just divorced and has the ex husband suffer under the acts of his former wife obviously having a relationship with her masseuse and finally a crazy hitchhiker who asks her drivers the most unusual questions and stretches their nerves by just being super-annoying.<br /><br />After having seen it you feel almost nothing. Youre not even shocked, sad, depressed or feel like doing anything... Maybe thats why I gave it 7 points, it made me react in a way I never reacted before.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110099/|I.Q. (1994)|This film is great. As often heard, it is indeed very realistic and sometimes brutal, but unlike some other people I am clearly not of the opinion that it is depressing, negativistic or dismantling Austria as a proto-fascist society. Quite the contrary: While there are indeed some very heavy scenes in HUNDSTAGE and some characters are to be called very bad persons, at the same time you watch love, beauty and humor in Ulrich Seidls film. And thats exactly what distinguishes HUNDSTAGE for me from other films that try to show the lives of the ordinary people in an intense, realistic way; their hustle, their wishes, their dark sides: Seidl clearly never tries to prove, that the lives of the working-class people are trash! In my opinion, viewers who come to this conclusion seem to be very afraid of admitting, that nearly nobodys live is as clean and normal as we would like other people to believe. And that every live has its dark and often depressing sides. The most beautiful scene: The old Viennese man, watching his old girl dancing the oriental way, as he is calling it. I think everybody who finds this scene ugly lacks a sense of beauty and should ask themselves what it is, thats proto-fascist: The characters in HUNDSTAGE or viewers, who are turned off by the body of a 70+ year old woman, dancing with all her charms for her lover.|0.171843905924|0.130555711557|0.828156094076

Its like Happiness with explicit sex and a less optimistic view of humanity. Theres animal poisoning, a strip-tease from a senior citizen, an orgyesque bathouse in a shopping centre, anal candle penetration, and the molestation of the mentally incompetent.<br /><br />If any of this sounds like too much to handle then this film isnt for you. This film shows humanity at its most desperate and pathetic. The banality of our existence is shoved in our face with utmost glee.<br /><br /> Seidl has no interest in redeeming humanity here. And why should he?

Then up and over a snowy mountain pass all Barefoot. It is sink or swim and climb or die. In search of grass for their animals. They have cows, goats, dogs, horses, mules.

They use rafts that are kept afloat by inflating goat skins - you can see where the head and legs were removed. The other bank of the river was very steep - Im guessing about a 60 degree rise.<br /><br />Just watching that was incredible, but there was much more to come. To get to the pastures, they also had to cross a major mountain that had about 4 feet of snow, if not more. Being able to climb this mountain was pretty amazing in and of itself, but they (and all of the animals) climbed this mountain barefoot!

While not all the events in the film are historically accurate (can you show me any historical film that succeeds in this?), I feel the film is accurate in its treatment of the role Lafitte played in New Orleans history, and the love-hate relationship between the respectable citizens of New Orleans and this outlaw who was one of the citys favorite sons. Dont worry about what the film doesnt do, but watch it for what it does do, i.e., for its study of one of New Orleans, and Americas, most intriguing historical figures.|0.162722707988|0.154775022984|0.837277292012

Its a typical Hollywood history epic, dramatized, stylized and full of inaccuracies but so what, its an entertaining movie and a good looking film. Cecil B. DeMille at the end of his life is the executive producer of this remake of his 1938 film. His son-in-law actor Anthony Quinn who had the supporting role of Beluche in the 38 film is the director in his directorial debut and swan song as he had never directed a film before and never would again. DeMille assembled a crew who had recently worked on his 10 Commandments to help Quinn pull it off including longtime DeMille associate producer/actor Henry Wilcoxon overseeing the project. Also from the 10 Commandments are screenwriter Jesse Lasky, cinematographer Loyalk Griggs, assistant director Francisco Day, 2nd unit director Arthur Rosson, art directors Walter Tyler and Hal Pereira, set directors Sam Comer and Ray Moyer, costume designers Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph Lester who as a costume design team received The Buccaneers only Oscar nomination. A great cast here from team DeMille headed up by Yul Brynner as pirate Jean Lafitte and Charleton Heston as future President General Andrew Jackson. Also in the cast are Charles Boyer, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Greene, Claire Bloom and Inger Stevens. At just over two hours it drags in some spots but makes up for it with some excellent battle scenes.

I love the mix of awesomely made fictional scenes. It is amazing set-design. The scenes look really like they were filmed in 1920ies or 1930ies.<br /><br />And the music is so nice.<br /><br />I rate this experience 9/10.<br /><br />* spoilers ahead *<br /><br />The Documentary tells about awesome Blues-men, with black-and-white old-looking scenes of the black man playing the guitar and singing. It is really amazing. But this also mixes in new bands and that is maybe one thing I might dislike in this Documentary. It is the too abundant use of links to modern rock-bands playing those Blues songs in a modern way. I didnt really appreciate their trashed way of playing such awesome Blues songs. This is the same kind of un-perfect musical taste I found when watching Wim Wenders Buena Vista Social Club.<br /><br />The Documentary was such a standing-ovation at this first screening in the little cinema, that the next day this Documentary was shown for everyone and normal tourists on the beach of the Croisette at the open-air cinema. Though the sand, the quality of the projection and the bad quality of the sound probably made it a difficult experience to enjoy for the thousands of people who were sitting in the sand that night.|0.255889143253|0.175692560087|0.744110856747
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107302/|Kalifornia (1993)|I was forced to see this because a) I have an 11 year-old girl and b) we had shown her the Bonita Granville Nacy Drew movies from the 1930s, which she thoroughly enjoyed. Personally, I didnt think it was as humorous as the 1930s flicks, but on the other hand, it wasnt the nauseating piece of intelligence-insulting fluff I feared it would be. It was an inoffensive, mildly entertaining movie. Although Im pleased that they didnt try to upgrade Nancy to 21st Century hipness (Veronica Mars holds the title as the Modern Nancy Drew), I do think that they made her a little too bland, that they didnt do enough to develop Nancy Drew - the movie could have been titled Jane Doe, Girl Detective. I have to blame the script: I think each actor did a good job with what they had to work with. I liked Emma Roberts in this role, but they gave her a made-for-TV, not theatrical release, script...|0.66054801879|0.154564561989|0.33945198121
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107302/|Kalifornia (1993)|I really liked this movie...it was cute. I enjoyed it, but if you didnt, that is your fault. Emma Roberts played a good Nancy Drew, even though she isnt quite like the books. The old fashion outfits are weird when you see them in modern times, but she looks good on them. To me, the rich girls didnt have outfits that made them look rich. I mean, it looks like they got all the clothes -blindfolded- at a garage sale and just decided to put it on all together. All of the outfits were tacky, especially when they wore the penny loafers with their regular outfits. I do not want to make the movie look bad, because it definitely wasnt!

Theres been a lot of movies lately based on video games, and I think this in one of them.<br /><br />So this movie does not follow any book. But it does follow parts of the games. I buy and play every Nancy Drew games as soon as it comes out. And the games are from HerInteractive and are for girls who arent afraid of a mouse! And some of these games actually won Parents Choice Gold Awards. They are not only fun but you can actually learn a thing or two while playing.<br /><br />I took two of my step children with me to go see it and they loved it! The 10 yr. old had started playing her first Nancy Drew game a day before I took her to see the movie, and she was having so much fun playing the game I thought she would enjoy the movie as well. And I was right...she not only loved this movie but couldnt wait to get home to finish her first game and start another one.<br /><br />My other step daughter is only 7 and she also loved the movie but she is still a little to young too play the games yet, but she enjoys watching her sister play at times just to see whats going on.<br /><br />The games are based for children 10 yrs and older. All the games usually get pretty descent reviews and are classified as adventure games. For more information on the games just check out HerInterative Nancy Drew games. So personally I thought the movie was pretty good and I will buy it when it comes out on DVD.|0.353975193751|0.208279327599|0.646024806249

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107302/|Kalifornia (1993)|Lets face it; Nancy Drew was never great literature. It is in the same category as babysitter club, magic tree house, Goosebumps, ABC Mysteries. In fact, it was one of the original formula stories. Nancy is perfect, pretty, thoughtful, nice, has no internal conflicts ever! and never changes. Ned is pretty much the same. The movie was true to that style and I have to say, I liked it. It will never be a great movie, but it had a that same nostalgic flavor that the books held. It had just the right amount of suspense for my children (8 and 10.) There was almost no offensive language. I liked the push for more conservative dress.<br /><br />Corky was a bit of an annoyance. He was a little out of place on a high school campus. I never quite got why he was there in the first place.|0.400861346519|0.381132078888|0.599138653481

After being over exposed to the likes of Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, and Paris Hilton, it was refreshing to see a girl who didnt look like she worked the streets. Also enjoyed seeing a supporting cast that included Tate Donovan, Rachel Leigh Cook, Barry Bostwick, and Monica Parker (with a cameo by Bruce Willis).

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107302/|Kalifornia (1993)|I really enjoyed this movie. It succeeded in doing something that few movies do now; it provided family values while entertaining me. Nancy Drew is a heroine for all generations and a role model for young girls to look up to. The little girls I was with throughly enjoyed the movie and kept talking about Nancy as we walked out of the theater. The movie has relatively few problems for families and I dont think parents will get bored sitting in the theater. No, it wont win an Oscar and it did not showcase magnificent special effects or even provide a horribly spooky mystery, but it entertained me and it stood true to the the spirit of the books. I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody with a young girl (she will love it!) or any fan of the books. You will not be disappointed.|0.404915974427|0.133559740994|0.595084025573
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107302/|Kalifornia (1993)|To be honest, I had to go see this movie backwards, didnt expect that much, but hey, I was not deceived, I had a good time.<br /><br />I would say this movie is way a fresh breeze, despite some facts that they tried to modernize Nancy Drew, but this made me remember these youth movies of the 60-70s from Europe and Quebec, where they manage to have children getting interacting with adults. In this case, a 16 year-old teenager tries to do justice by trying to solve a mystery concerning the death of an actress who died 25 years ago. Anyway, as her dad had business in Hollywood, why not rent a home with a mystery behind doors ? Well, at least Emma Roberts does a great job here. Kinda like the chubby kid, who at first is naively brought to support his sisters pranks to Nancy, but at the end, found Nancy quite cool enough to stick with her, even with her matters...<br /><br />Rest of the supporting cast is great, and was happy to see Rachael Leigh Cook in a different role this time: a single mother (she did it in Family Rescue, but this time, she plays a mature woman...)

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113305/|Higher Learning (1995)|Across the great divide which we call understanding, there is still much we do not know about that which was explained by the early tribal Elders. In every instance, there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much. Conversely, there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the End Time. In this movie called  The Last Wave  an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent less they disturb the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the Defense Attorney assigned to defend the accused. Although haunted by prophetic images from his own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by an sympathetic Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton proceeds to defend the infraction as Tribal Law and therefore not subject to standard justice. The movie is fraught with puzzling, dark foreboding images of apocalyptic end world disasters and warns of a future island tsunami and doom. Black drama and deep rituals are what gives this film its frightening allure and therefore is not for the faint-hearted, in fact the simplest haunting apparitions can last for years in the nightmares of innocent movie goers. Good silent drama. ****|0.269076813538|0.827564927034|0.730923186462
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113305/|Higher Learning (1995)|I used to write comments at IMDb, but I dont do so anymore. It happens that IMDb has become massive, and consequently subjectiveness has ruined scores. What do I mean? That anyone that is not particularly fond of movies and doesnt have any expertise on the subject, watches some crap (or the opposite), and in case he likes it, delivers a 10, and if he doesnt he goes for a 1. This of course, cannot measure anything correctly. Now for the film. I truly regret ever having delivered any 10s to some very few films, because then I must score this one with 12 or 13, which is not possible. This documentary has something that I dont expect to watch ever again in my whole life in any other film. It is simply mesmerizing, and its not just a way of saying; it really is. The last 25 minutes have a load of energy, visual rejoice and wisdom -the words spoken by the starring guys-, that really... theres no possible match. I dont keep movies, rarely would I find any sense in doing so, but this one is the kind of film you should buy and keep, and watch from time to time, maybe 10 or 20 times as years go by.

None taught me what this movie did * The movie was very well edited. It flowed well.

The focus is on the pioneers of big wave surfing from the 60s Greg Noll to our current Laird Hamilton, from Waimea Bay to Mavericks to Jaws. Hell, I could watch a movie just about Laird Hamilton - one of this generations great athletes - so the rest is just gravy.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113305/|Higher Learning (1995)|Riding Giants is an incredible documentary detailing the history and stories of three influential big-wave surfers, Gregg Noll, Jeff Clark, and Laird Hamilton. Stacy Peralta did an amazing job taking on the role of director and should be congratulated for doing such a brilliant job. The structure of the film is edited brilliantly and works perfectly with the narration, interviews, animation and surfing footage. The music soundtrack just adds to the overall satisfaction of watching this film, making Riding Giants brilliant viewing. Personal highlights include any of Greg Nolls comments, what with his straight-to-the-point frankness, Laird Hamiltons footage at Teahupoo, and the out-takes at the end of the movie.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113305/|Higher Learning (1995)|The director and two stars of LAURA (1944) were reteamed for this solid policier: Dana Andrews is the son of a criminal who becomes a cop to cut all ties with the past but cannot keep his inherited violent ways in check while interrogating suspects and, one night, he goes too far; Gene Tierney is the estranged wife of his victim, a decorated war hero who has become involved with the towns leading racketeer and Andrews No. 1 nemesis, Gary Merrill (who had himself been the protégé of Andrews Snr.)! As usual with Preminger, this is a well-crafted movie with a notable opening credits sequence and enlivened by a good cast that also includes Karl Malden (as Andrews incumbent superior), Tom Tully (as Tierneys motor-mouth taxi driver dad) and Neville Brand (as Merrills chief thug), with notable support also coming from Craig Stevens (as the slimy, wife-beating victim), Bert Freed (as Andrews sympathetic partner) and Robert F. Nolan (as Andrews stern outgoing superior). Having already been warned by the latter to mend his ways or else, Andrews panics and impersonates Stevens for a couple of hours following his murder to put the police on the (in this case) wrong tracks of Merrill; however, after Tully becomes the prime suspect (by which time Andrews and Tierney are romantically involved), the cop goes by himself in Merrills lair fully intending to get bumped off and frame the racketeer for his own murder! Clearly, the protagonist is a complex character and Andrews rises to the challenge with a first-rate characterization that is typically complemented by the in-house Fox noir style.|0.460098186015|0.806145531548|0.539901813985

Close-ups of Danas eyes reveal the anguish within, Karl Malden excels as his boss, who brooks no nonsense but also has compassion for those under his command in the precinct. <br /><br />Otto Preminger made this type of movie just about his own. If there is any fault it would be with the breath taking beauty of Gene Tierney who seems oddly out of place with the hardened cop. Their scenes in the cafe, however, are wonderful and ring true. <br /><br />Tom Tully, in the bit part of her father is perfect as is Gary Merrill as the hood. Great lighting and mood setting.

Then we meet Det. Sgt. Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews), who always wanted to be something his old man wasnt: a guy on the right side of the law. But hes pretty vicious for a good guy. After several complaints over his roughing people up, his boss, Insp. Nicholas Foley (Robert F. Simon), demotes him. Foley tells him hes a good man, but needs to get his head on straight and be more like Det. Lt. Thomas (Karl Malden), who has just gotten a promotion.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Tommy Scalise (Gary Merrill, in a splendidly slimy performance) has an illegal dice game going and is looking to make a sucker out of the rich Ted Morrison (Harry Von Zell), who was brought in by Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) and his beautiful wife Morgan (Gene Tierney). She figures out too late her husband is using her as a decoy, and Paine strikes her when she refuses to play along. The chivalrous Morrison intervenes but Paine knocks him out cold. That seems to be the worst of it, but later it turns out the guy is dead; and Paine looks guilty.<br /><br />But this wont be Paines story. Soon Dixon has fallen in love with Morganbut not before losing his temper again and committing a terrible deed that he tries to cover up. Morgans father, a tale-spinning taxi driver (Tom Tully), may take the rap for it. Its up to Dixon to try to pin the blame on Scalise.<br /><br />Otto Preminger directs a script credited to Ben Hecht and three others from the novel Night Cry by William L. Stuart. This is a solid film noir with excellent performances and all the shadowy photography and murky morality we expect from this genre. It holds up until the brightly lit ending, which looks like something the studio had filmed to appease the censors. Of course, the classic noir directed by Preminger and starring Andrews and Tierney is Laura. Youll enjoy this, but you cant miss that.|0.669482558207|0.386228961443|0.330517441793

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113305/|Higher Learning (1995)|Dana Andrews is one of those actors that Ive probably seen in a dozen films, but who has never really registered for me. Often stolid, taciturn, playing the same kinds of roles and looking somewhat like the similarly underrated Glenn Ford, hes an actor that takes some effort to really appreciate; but once you hit the right film....<br /><br />And this is it. Premingers moody look at New Yorks underbelly is as dirty and seedy as just about any 50s noir, and Andrews is in his element as too-tough cop Mark Dixon who just doesnt know how to play the game to get ahead: he hates criminals too much to always play by the rules. Early on in the film, he accidentally kills the witness to a murder involving an illegal crap game set up by a mobster who Dixon hates for personal reasons, and he spends the rest of the film trying to cover up his involvement and bring the mobster to his kind of justice. Along the way he gets involved with the estranged wife of the man he killed (Gene Tierney) and also has to try to get her father off the hook for the murder.<br /><br />Stunningly photographed by Joseph LaShelle, with hard and sparkling dialogue by Ben Hecht and a truly powerful ending with elements of tragedy and found grace in just a minute or two of time, this is another noir for the ages and might be my favorite Preminger film thus far -- its every bit as good as the more-heralded Laura.|0.418987263217|0.0976349940141|0.581012736783

Its witty jokes and even its occasional stereotypical and derogatory views on Eastern European people had me in stitches throughout most of the film. Its plot is clever and 100% original and will have you guessing throughout the entire film. The one person I was most impressed with in this film was Hilary Duff. Its plain and simple to see that she has taken a leap of faith stepped outside of the chick-flick genre shes used to. Her accent is excellent and her acting performance was surprisingly crisp and well-executed. It is the best performance I have ever seen from Hilary, and I have seen most of her films. Her character, Yonica Babyyeah is described as The Britney Spears of Eastern Europe and this is seen in some of her mannerisms and the song, I want to blow you... ... ... up. You also feel sorry for her, as her performance really grasps you, Yonica is a very complex and confused character. Joan Cusack had me laughing throughout the whole film with her sometimes slapstick humour, but also her facial expressions and so on. John Cusacks witty dialogue will probably make you chuckle throughout. I strongly recommend this film.|0.229225682373|0.141868133787|0.770774317627

If you are familiar with the antics of Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown & Root and Blackwater overseas you are already halfway home to fully appreciating the satire of Cusacks latest piece. Cusack plays a corporate hit-man named Brand Hauser who finds himself in Turiquistan organizing a trade show in the newly liberated country as his cover while waiting to get access to his latest target. While there he finds himself intrigued by the anti-establishment reporter played by Marisa Tomei and pursued by the over-sexualized pop star played by Hilary Duff. We are introduced to Hausers past, which includes a tragedy that has haunted him ever since and the corporate assistant named Marsha Dillon who actually is running the entire operation for him (and played hilariously by Joan Cusack). While some moments are played suitably over the top, they arent always the moments you expect and the little touches often catch you by surprise. All the principals turn in solid performances. Duffs accent comes and goes but otherwise she does a very nice job and goes a long way to dispel her Disney image. Tomei is funny but understated while the Cusacks own nearly every scene they are in. To be fair, they are given good material. The writers turn in a good script with enough twists and turns and visual gags to keep you giggling throughout all the way to the predictable conclusion. In fact, the predictability of the end is the only thing that keeps me from rating it higher as the story twists and turns its way to the expected conclusion.<br /><br />If you like your comedy broad and physical, there is probably not enough here to keep you interested the entire movie.

As for the cast, Bruce Willis and the beautiful Madeleine Stowe (whatever happened to her??) are just OK, but Brad Pitt is so annoying, whenever he plays roles that are out of his hand he results so forced and hes not credible at all.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109403/|Chasers (1994)|One of the all-time great science fiction works, as visionary and thought-provoking as Blade Runner or even Gilliams own Brazil. Willis gives his best performance here, but hes outdone by Pitts incredibly frenetic turn thats unlike anything hes done before or since. Even Stowe isnt out of her league here, though. The story is very layered and offers quite a lot to think about. The climactic scene is beautifully magnificent, and the last lines fit perfectly. The scenes in the mental hospital are creepy and yet so funny in their own way. Lots of dark humour on display here. Fantastic production design and suitably bizarre cinematography.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109403/|Chasers (1994)|I really enjoyed this -- Im a big fan of movies that mess with your mind and leave you with a lot of questions and ideas to debate, and this was a stellar example. But then, Terry Gilliam is always good at that (well, almost always. Lets just forget about Jabberwocky and The Brothers Grimm, shall we?).<br /><br />I particularly liked the way it handled the time travel theme and the avoidance of paradoxes -- the way events in the past and future intertwined and fed into each other.<br /><br />It was also really well done aesthetically -- the art direction was really great, and I wish Id been able to see it on the big screen. The future scenes had a similar feel to Brazil in a lot of ways, and even the present scenes were often really visually compelling.<br /><br />But perhaps the most striking thing about it was that it featured two actors I normally dont much like, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, and they both delivered amazing performances here. Pitt especially -- Id seen one or two films before that made me realize he could in fact actually act (contrary to what Id originally thought), but this one really outdid them. I actually found myself asking my friends at one point Are you SURE thats Brad Pitt? This is probably the most memorable performance of his career (though admittedly that may not be saying too much).|0.231936724316|0.137642450165|0.768063275684

He has all the stereotypical notions about blindness, and is sure hell be a burden to everyone. The hospital staff and his fellow wounded Marines cant get through to him. Neither can his girl back home played by Eleanor Parker. Hes stubborn and blinded by his own fears, self pity, and prejudices. Its a complex role that Garfield carries off memorably in a great performance that keeps one watching in spite of the ever present syrupy melodrama. The best scenes are on Guadalcanal, where hes in a machine gun nest trying to fend off the advancing Japanese soldiers in a hellish looking night time battle, and later a dream sequence in the hospital where he sees himself walking down a train platform with a white cane, dark glasses, and holding out a tin cup, all the while his girlfriend walks backward away from the camera.|0.298973462434|0.868385613631|0.701026537566

An excellent cast of actors helps make this movie very entertaining. Eleanor Parkers role as the girlfriend was worthy of an Oscar nomination. She has such an innocence to her in this movie. Ann Doran role was equally satisfying as was all of her small supporting roles. I especially like the hometown aura of pre-war Phildelphia. The hunting scene is very good. Of course the war scene on Guadalcanal truly showed the horror faced by our soldiers during this epic battle.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116953/|Mad Dog Time (1996)|Being from the Philadelphia suburbs and extremely interested in local history, this film provides an excellent vintage view of Philadelphia in the 1940s. There are scenes of downtown, a train station that no longer exists, 30th Street Station--which still does exist, as well as scenes from the Northeast part of the city. Good shots of the old row-homes as they appeared then. The movie gets a bit chatty at times - causing the viewer to briefly lose interest...but the overall storyline is solid and very moving. Anyone who enjoyed this movie should also try to see the film Bright Victory, also with local footage of the Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, PA - and scenes from downtown Phoenixville. The Army Hospital has since become a college campus. Neither of these films are out on any format and I cant imagine why. I have them both on VHS from home recording, as shown on TCM in recent years. I highly recommend them to any other history buffs out there from my area!|0.123066044721|0.209615859045|0.876933955279
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116953/|Mad Dog Time (1996)|Definitely at the top five of best John Garfield movies has to be Pride of the Marines. Its the true story of Marine private Al Schmid who at the cost of his own sight, while wounded held off a horde of storming Japanese on Guadalcanal. <br /><br />The story nicely segments in three parts, Al Schmids home life where hes a simple working stiff whos just getting serious with a woman and who likes nothing better than his bowling night. Pearl Harbor is bombed and hes off to war as millions of others were.<br /><br />The second part is at Guadalcanal and we see part of the action where hes in an isolated machine gun nest, holding off Japanese troops. His action prevented Marine positions from being overrun, but a grenade does in his eyesight.<br /><br />And of course the third part is his painful adjustment to civilian life and to reassure himself that people arent just caring for him out of pity, most of all that girl he was seeing Eleanor Parker.<br /><br />This film was broadcast on TCM on John Garfields 95th birthday and there was a documentary on Garfield hosted by his daughter. One of the people interviewed said that Garfield was the actor most believable in working class roles in having and holding a union card. <br /><br />In that respect he was lucky in that he did land with Warner Brothers in Hollywood. Though he kept getting typecast in gangster roles in the tradition of that studio, Garfield was terrific in these parts because of his background, because he came from the kind of life Al Schmid had, with the exception of Garfields Jewish background.<br /><br />In that respect he was perfect to play the part of a working class hero like Al Schmid who accepted the responsibility of defending his country. No super heroics here, just a guy whod rather have been back in Philadelphia, but doing a job that had to be done.<br /><br />Its a great part for Garfield. Its a film one shouldnt miss. I do wonder though whatever happened to the real Al Schmid.|0.142362335809|0.846531440939|0.857637664191

Although it is tough and unpleasant it IS in the end heroic - Schmids triumph over disability and depression. The battle scene was superb. But one bone to pick. No matter how many .50 bullets they fired I never saw any water or dirt being kicked up by the impacts! It hurt the realism, but I can live with it.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116953/|Mad Dog Time (1996)|This movie is a fantastic movie. Everything about it in my opinion was top notch from the acting to the directing. I know Mr. Garfield was blacklisted in the 1950s but the majority of his other films are on video if not DVD. That being the case,why isnt this one? A friend recorded it off of TCM for me but to have it on DVD would be great. For special features they could have say a Marine historian talk about the battle and if Mr. Schmids wife or son are still alive they could be interviewed as well. Anyway this is a great movie and I highly recommend it.If it ever is put out hopefully it wont be colorized. Colorizing it would in my opinion just ruin the whole effect of the film. The battle scene was quite realistic as far as a 1945,film would go. Mr. Garfield did a superb job of portraying Mr. Schmid. Some actors might have been tempted to overact the part of Mr.Schmids disability but I feel he got it just right. I sincerely hope they come out with this movie on DVD someday as a tribute to the courage of Al Schmid and all the other marines who sacrificed so much for us in World War Two.|0.336821086214|0.153547159415|0.663178913786

Major, US Marine Corps), was in Guadalcanal and lost his leg to the Japanese, and also received the Navy Cross. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that my father was the technical adviser of this film and I am hoping that he had an impact on the film in making it resemble how it really was back then, as I read in various comments written by the viewers of this film that it seemed like real-life. My father is a fanatic of facts and figures, and always wanted things to be seen as they were so I would like to believe he had something to do with that.<br /><br />He currently lives in Okinawa, Japan, married to my mother for over 40 years (ironically, shes Japanese), and a few years ago was awarded one of the highest commendations from the Emperor of Japan for his contribution and activities of bringing back Kendo and Iaido to Japan since McArthur banned them after WWII.<br /><br />My father was once a marine but I know that once you are a marine, youre always a marine.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116953/|Mad Dog Time (1996)|Most war films made in the US during WWII were great fun to watch but suffered from severe gaps in realism because they were being produced more for propaganda value to raise the spirits at home than anything else. I am not knocking these films as many of them are still very watchable. However, because they so often lack realism they are prevented from being truly great films. A perfect example was the John Garfield film Air Force--in which a B-17 nearly single-handedly takes out half the Japanese air force! However, Pride Of The Marines is a welcome departure--scoring high marks for portraying a true story in a reasonably accurate manner. When I first saw this film, I thought it was NOT a true story as it seemed way too improbable to be true. However, after researching further I found that it was in fact rather true to the amazing story of two men who did so much to earn the Medal of Honor. This is one case where real life seemed too incredible to be true!|0.0977546313662|0.152619396934|0.902245368634
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116953/|Mad Dog Time (1996)|In the immediate aftermath following World War II, sound minds in Hollywood tried to distance themselves from the mindless flag-waving that is a natural ingredient in a war effort. Best Years of Our Lives and even Gentlemans Agreement investigated the way Americans looked at themselves in the wake of the war, but Delmer Daves Pride of the Marines beat them to it.<br /><br />The film is about Philadelphia smart alec John Garfield who goes to war as a marine and after a nightmarish evening in a foxhole, with Japanese soldiers eerily crying out at him and his buddies Mariiines, tonight you die!, he is blinded by a hand-grenade, and dumps his girlfriend back home rather than have to depend on her after coming home.<br /><br />Delmer Daves is uncompromising in his depiction on these men who are brave, as it were, almost by coincidence. They are there, in the foxhole, and when shot at, they react. So much for heroism, but they get the job done. And then comes the self-pity, the dark, gloomy sense of humor. Garfield is in angry denial of his blindness and the film makes no excuses, Theres no free candy for anyone in this world, as his buddy tells him. The same guy, a Jew, played by Dane Clark, reminds him, In a war somebody gets it, and youre it. Everybodys got problems! When I get back, some guys wont hire me, because my name is Diamond.<br /><br />Great movies are made with guts like these, and if the first half hour of Pride of the Marines fails to rise to the occasion completely, from then on it evolves into a true work of art. You weep, and you ponder, you ache and you hope against hope. Well, simply: art.<br /><br />|0.233090275076|0.642199197404|0.766909724924
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116953/|Mad Dog Time (1996)|Sometimes I watch a movie and am really impressed by it  and still it is not easy to explain why I liked it that much. This is mostly true for the uncommon movies  the ones one can hardly compare with the rest out there. Goodnight Mister Tom is one of these special movies. There is a lot of emotion in that movie  and the acting was so good that while watching the movie, I was crying and laughing as the story went on. The young Nick Robinson  is a young boy (William) evacuated from London because of the air strikes there during the Second World War. Mr. Tom played by John Thaw is an old man leaving in the village the evacuated children were send to.<br /><br />At first Tom refuses to take any responsibilities - such as taking care for a troubled young lad  but accepts since he is left without a choice. During the stay Mr. Tom discovers how horrible the life has been for the William  alongside his luggage his mom sent a belt and written instructions to the host of her son  not to hesitate to use it. This belt is berried in the field  never to be used in such a brutal manner. Mr. Tom provides a real home for William, and the boy is happy with his new life, he goes to school, makes new friends and discovers hidden talents. All of the sudden a letter William is called home in London with a letter mentioning that she is not feeling welland it starts all over again  only this time it gets much worse There are many feelings you can sense in this movie  love, fear, sadness, happiness, pain, hope  and much more. Goodnight Mr. Tom is another masterpiece of the British cinema comparable only with others such as Dear Frankie and Billy Elliot  if one is to compare. I have truly enjoyed watching it and highly recommend it. Before finishing this review I would also like to mention the great performance of Thomas Orange in the role of Zac  reminded me of a friend of mine from my own childhood ( :|0.110187996171|0.813341795255|0.889812003829

The boy playing William did a good job as well though I didnt find him convincing in every scene. I loved the whole feel of the small village and the slower pace of life in those times. I also felt the scenes in London where historically accurate, as far as I could tell.<br /><br />It strongly reminded me of a Scandinavian film I saw a couple of years ago called Mother of Mine. That film featured a boy being evacuated from Finland to Sweden during WW II. The wife of the family taking him in asked for a girl because (as it turns out)she lost her daughter. Getting a boy instead she completely ignores him. The fact that the boy speaks Finnish complicates matters even further. I highly recommend that film to anyone who enjoyed Goodnight Mr. Tom, it has the same feel to it.|0.201139630005|0.123601314335|0.798860369995

No, not at all. John Thaw is mesmerising as Tom Oakley. His transformation from gruff to caring was so well realised, making it more believable than Scrooge in Christmas Carol. After Inspector Morse, this is Thaws finest hour. He was matched earnestly by a young Nick Robinson, who gave a thoroughly convincing portrayal of an evacuee traumatised by the abusive relationship with his mother. The script and music made it worth the buy, and you also see Thaw playing the organ. Amazing! The most moving scene, was Willie finding out about Zaks death, and then Tom telling him about his deceased family who died of scarlatina.

The love between the two main characters may be more than fraternal. I believe that Heaton is in love with Spike, but Spike is too naive to see this.<br /><br />I really feel this is portrayed with such scenes as the blow back and letter writing sequences. Heaton shows great intimacy towards Spike. With intense facial expressions and how he takes great care in writing Spikes name on the top of his letters.<br /><br />One thing Ive noticed when looking at external reviews, is that when the film has been slated, the reviewer seems to have not fully understood the film, as they havent even mentioned the possibility of Heaton having sexual feelings for Spike. I also get the feeling that some of the reviewers havent recognised it, when they use phrases like: Who is Heaton? Whats he doing with a retard like Spike? This person, however may have hit the nail on the head with their remark. Spike shows noticeable signs of having A.D.D, although I dont think this person has realised this, as he seems to be using the word retard as a derogatory term.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film. Although it is not for the faint hearted. The film is exceedingly character based, after the shooting until the end there isnt much but dialogue between the two anti-heroes.

Instead of the cursed videotape, we instead having a haunted studio and strange images appearing on film. In fact, the strange images appearing on film brings immediately the cursed videotape in RINGU to mind. The only thing missing was the obsession to water that runs through Nakatas later films.

Forward to the 1979, repeat the same plot, but throw in DA RAMONES, whom no one then realized would become one of the most influential bands of the next quarter century (and then for the obligatory DJ guest shot, The Real Don Steele).

There is no way the character of Miklos, claiming and pushing for room in every way possible, wont push your nerves to the edge...2 thumbs up!|0.368500896868|0.104307654336|0.631499103132
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100332/|Paris Is Burning (1990)|Extremely tense thriller set in the urban chaos of São Paulo, the biggest and ugliest third world nightmare in Brazilian urbania. For the sake of making it easy for anyone who is curious about this intriguing and truly well made film, it has the grit of Mexican feature Amores Perros with a character not too far off Max Cady, from both Cape Fears, although this is not, by any means, a film about a psychopath. Two partners (Alexandre Borges and Marco Ricca) in a construction company pay hitman Anisio (Miklos) to off their third partner (and majority share holder) in said construction outfit. The murder is blamed on the city, but things begin to look very grim indeed when witty and charismatic walking nightmare Anisio decides he wants to be around the ever so nervous partners in crime, not only trespassing but, more importantly, deconstructing the strict social codes that make up Brazilian society. Anisio turns poverty into an attitude and he wants in. The look is almost entirely handheld, grainy, the performances outstanding throughout, especially so as first time actor (and member of classic Brazilian pop band Titãs), Paulo Miklos, dazzles and baffles the viewer with his pretty funny social terror.<br /><br />I saw the film at the Brasília film Fest in November 2001. It has since done very well in Sundance and Berlin. Kleber Mendonça Filho|0.22357293054|0.236765865818|0.77642706946
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100332/|Paris Is Burning (1990)|Whoopi was the only reason I watched the Oscars that year. She is hilarious. Of course there was a major serious side to the show. She was great not only because shes funny, but because she said some things that needed to be said in a public forum. White folks need to be reminded that Hollywood awards ceremonies, employment, and representation are WAY out of balance racially. There should be no need for black awards shows. The white-bread, milquetoast nominators and judges need to bring their heads into the sunshine and see that great material is not limited to white directors, producers, actors, etc. Allowing Woody Allen on the air was the depth of poor taste. He had no business being there. The fact of the matter is, this is the first Oscar presentation Ive watched since The Color Purple was up for awards. That miscarriage of voting soured me on watching the shows until 2002. Which is not to denigrate other presenters. Billy Crystal is a riot.|0.651070349099|0.155477119721|0.348929650901
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114658/|Theodore Rex (1995)|I enjoyed this movie quite a lot. I have always been a fan of Whoopi Goldberg and this movie only emphasizes it. She portrays a housewife in an African-American family which is moving up the social chain due to the husbands (Danny Glover) success as an attorney. She moves to an all white neighborhood where the people are friendly, yet a little awkward toward her. The various events that arise during the course of the movie make for SOME laughs but mostly appeal to the other emotions. This movie is not so much a comedy as a drama. I give it a strong 8/10.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114658/|Theodore Rex (1995)|this is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue. what dialogue there is appears in word baloons as it would in the manga. the plot of this is existent but only vaguely accounted for. there is an issue of the manga on which this is based available in english in the blast books collection, comics underground japan, and it has actual captioned dialogue that explains the plot a bit more than here. i recommend checking that volume out if you liked this, as it explains some of the plot of the movie, which is otherwise inexplicable. animation wise this is pretty decent, good unintrusive use of computers and the images are for the most part realized well. it jumps in and out of episodes, as the characters, a cat and his brain-dead older sister cat wander in and out of a series of odd images: a boat, a circus, a desert. for a mere half hour they go through a number of semi-plots and settings, which leads me to believe that the director chose a number of issues of the long-running manga to adapt at random, but primarilly selected visually. knowing whats going on might somewhat increase appreciation. this reminds me mostly of the kind of stuff they used to play on the mtv show, cartoon sushi, in particular a short that features a cat chasing a mans severed butt-cheek around the house. only in this case the cats resemble hello kitty more and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and a number of other themes [though not all that easy to tell whats going on]. the dvd of this has directors commentary and a making of features, but i cant comment on those because i didnt get around to them. im giving this a 8/10 for now, here isnt much to compare it to in anime, and i hope for more like this.|0.563743560501|0.158234133681|0.436256439499
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/|Titanic (1997)|Fabulous film! Rented the DVD recently and was floored by this stunning piece of work. Douglas Sirk was a filmmaking genius and he gets performances out of Rock Hudson, Dorothy Malone (Oscar winner), Robert Stack (Oscar nominated), and Lauren Bacall that words cannot describe. Paul Verhoeven brilliantly payed homage to this film by having Dorothy Malone play Sharon Stones murdering inspirational guru in his Basic Instinct. What a great joke!<br /><br /> By turns the film is hilarious, riveting, campy, biting, trashy, compelling, and eye rolling! Its definately the grandaddy of every tawdry big-and-little screen soap opera but none have had the dazzling style like youll see here: the camera work is smooth and polished, the use of color is breathtaking, the opening montage set to the title song is beyond memorable, the one dimensional characters are unforgettable, and the final image will have you scratching your head as to how the censors back then let it make the final cut!<br /><br /> While most older, highly regarded films can sometimes be a boring chore to sit through, Written on the Wind contains so much and goes by so fast that its actually a shame when it ends. Thank you to Mr. Sirk for crafting -and Todd Haynes for drawing attention to- what has now become one of my favorite films of all time! SEE THIS MOVIE!!!|0.320882975182|0.0816919192921|0.679117024818
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/|Titanic (1997)|Another in the they dont make em like that category. This story of a family with some real skeletons in its closet still qualifies as good clean, sometimes over-the-top fun. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are at their peak as the troubled Hadley siblings, and they really took the roles and ran with them. Malone won an Oscar and Stack was nominated in the supporting categories, both honors being eminently well-deserved. They counterbalance the somewhat bland leads. Neither Bacall nor Hudson could ever be called bad actors, but theyve both had better parts and played them far more convincingly than they do here. Its kind of hard for me to accept Rock Hudson playing such a red-blooded heterosexual as he does here, but thats more of a personal bias than anything else. But that doesnt take away from the movies overall entertainment value, which is considerable and this movie is extremely watchable. If youre up some night and this movie comes on Id say watch it.

However, Bacall is secretly loved by Stacks best friend, Rock Hudson. And Stacks nymphomaniac sister, Dorothy Malone, lusts after Rock. Throw in a few complications and the movie goes spinning out of control (in a good way).<br /><br />Very glossy movie in beautiful Technicolor with jaw-dropping fashions and furnishings (check out Bacalls hotel room at the beginning). Everybody looks perfect and dresses in beautiful, form-fitting clothes. Basically this is a soap opera with grade A production values. The story itself is lots of fun and some of the dialogue at the beginning is hilariously over the top. The acting by Hudson, Stack and Bacall isnt that good, but seeing them so young and glamorous is great...especially Stack...when he smiled my knees went weak! Dorothy Malone, on the other hand, is fantastic--she deservedly won Best Supporting Actress for her role. Shes sexy, violent, vicious and sympathetic...all convincingly. <br /><br />Fun, glossy trash. Dont miss it!|0.322656306279|0.404571301687|0.677343693721

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/|Titanic (1997)|Robert Stack never really got over losing a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Kyle in Written on the Wind to Anthony Quinns 12-minute performance in Lust for Life. Stack plays the deeply disturbed, alcoholic son of an oil tycoon. He has lived his life in the shadow of the friend with whom he was raised, Mitch, played by Rock Hudson. They both love the same woman, Lucy, (Lauren Bacall), who becomes Kyles wife. Kyles sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone), is a drunken slut whos in love with Mitch. Their story plays out in glorious color under the able direction of Douglas Sirk, who really dominated the melodrama field with some incredible films, including Imitation of Life, All that Heaven Allows, Magnificent Obsession, and many others.<br /><br />Make no mistake - this is a potboiler, and Stack and Dorothy Malone make the most of their roles, Malone winning a Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Theres one amazing scene, mentioned in other comments, where she wildly dances to loud music as her father collapses and dies on the staircase. Were led to believe that Marylee sleeps with everyone, including the guy that pumps the gas, because shes in love with Mitch. Mitch wants nothing to do with her. Hes so in love with Lucy that, out of loyalty to Kyle, he wants to go to work in Iran to avoid temptation. I doubt hed be so anxious to get there today no matter how much in love he was.<br /><br />Hudson and Bacall have the less exciting roles here - Hudsons Mitch is the good guy whos been cleaning up Kyles messes for his entire life, and Bacall is Mitchs wife who finds herself in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking again after a year of sobriety. Sirk focuses on the more volatile supporting players.<br /><br />In Sirks hands, Written on the Wind is an effective film, and the big scene toward the end in the mansion is particularly exciting.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/|Titanic (1997)|This movie was directed by Victor Nunez who also wrote the screenplay (Ulees Gold). Nice and straightforward writing, that was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award, looking at Rubys day to day life. What we see is a slice in the life of the young woman Ruby. Ashley Judd (Sisters) won the Independent Spirit Award Best Female Lead for this role. Ruby is starting to live on her own and establishing her own identity. She explores jobs, friendships, boy friends, sex, a typical young adult search. The movie won Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. As an independent film enthusiast I picked the movie because of Sundance. I appreciate this type of movie, because it does not carry the Hollywood baggage.<br /><br />Although the stories are completely different this reminded me of Nobodys Fool, staring Paul Newman. The later movie is a slice of the daily life of a common man. I like that. The story is very nicely told, and all we had to do was sit and enjoy the story. The only thing I am not sure about is the title. I am sure that there are not that many bugs, and flies in paradise as there are in Florida. As I am allergic to mosquitos, Florida is no paradise to me, I itch all over thinking about Florida. I turn into a complete red boil. I recommend this movie! Favorite scenes: Ruby and her friend Rochelle Bridges, played by Allison Dean walking at the beach of Panama City, Florida. Indeed the sand is very white. I have been there. Favorite Quotes: Necessity has always been a good excuse.

However, the girl is resold to the farmer Lourenço (Otávio Augusto) that deflowers her, and he gives the abused girl to his teenager son to have his first sexual experience.

Director and writer Rudi Lagemann presents a great movie exposing the reality but never showing nudity or explicit sexual scenes. It is the debut of the promising Fernanda Carvalho, who has an excellent performance in the role of a scared child fighting for survival. Most of the prostitutes are amateurs, and it is impossible to recognize the famous Darlene Glória so different she is after many plastic surgeries.

However, I have seen him one more time than you have, and is that, that I recommend Fear of a Black Hat to you for quick laughs.<br /><br />Remember, Dont shoot to you see the whites!....of their eyes?

This movie is crazy hilarious, and incorporates a lot more about the hip hop industry than any other parody movie... It is unfortunate that this movie has not been released on dvd because it is one movie that everybody Ive ever watched it with has loved and wanted a copy. If you really want a good laugh and you like hip hop and are a little familiar with some old-school performers, definitley rent this movie.

More like Spinal Tap than anything else, the film is clever from the start. Surprising anyone who saw it back in the mid nineties. The performances are played for laughs but not so much so that they are cartoon characters, more like Marx brothers. These guys are real and slightly diverse. They react to situations like any of us might. Well, we may not throw a tantrum when our performance hats are late to the gig, or pull guns and beat down a record company exec, but you get the picture. N(n***as) W(with) H(hats) takes itself seriously enough to reel you in, then youre hooked. rent or get this at all costs, even if youre not really into rap music, this will still leave you gassing out loud.

I was a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other early rap and had seen CB4 in theaters. Anyway, the promo for it caught my eye, and I wanted to see what it was all about. Well, right off the bat I knew it was going to be good (WARNING!) and I was right. The parody songs alone make this movie worth watching over and over (My Peanuts), but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was great. Youve got to love the satire of rap groups (obviously NWA), certain rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube), and the humor of the three members of NWH. Who can forget Tone Deaf scratching with his ass? Its too bad this movie didnt get the credit it deserved, as it was overshadowed by CB4 during their releases, but in my opinion is a much better film.

Its pretty much a sequel of This Is Spinal Tap in the sense that it is the same movie, just about rap instead or rock. Yet its hilarious. There are many funny jokes but not without a few jokes that just fall flat. The characters are all very funny and believable. I watched just because it made me laugh at 3 a.m., and any movie that can do that warrants at least a test screening. One of the reasons why this movies was so funny was that it makes fun of rap from a different. Rap today is concerned with the wrong things and get by with studio noise and little talent. This movie comes from a time where rappers deserved more credit. Overall, its a funny movie with many jokes about racism, sex and music culture among the more obvious themes of humor. This is highly recommend for any fan of This is Spinal Tap. They are essentially the same movie, just about different worlds, and yes, the same jokes work in both movies.|0.362672680071|0.170498084294|0.637327319929
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112471/|Before Sunrise (1995)|I first saw this movie when it came out in 1994 and just watched it recently and it is STILL funny. I dont know if you have to understand hiphop in the 90s, but it helps if you do. In the 90s when NWA and Public Enemy were at the top, there were internal strife within the groups and members when their separated ways (Ice Cube, Easy E, etc). Also there were the wanna bs, accessible rappers that start making the scene (Vanilla Ice, Freedom Williams from C&C Music Factory, etc). This movie makes fun of all of that in a way that seems like its an actually documentary. Kasi Lemmons plays an interviewer that spends a year in the life of a fictitious rap group name N.W.H. The members of the group are Ice Code (Rusty Condieff/director), Tasty Taste (Larry B Scott/Revenge of the Nerds, and Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence). They are an up and coming rap group whose politics makes them controversial. Whats good about this film is that it is so thourough in its portrayal of the hiphop industry of the 80s and they way it pokes fun at it. But, if you know 80s/90s rap, you know how much of this stuff is true. Still, on its own, without hip hop knowledge, it is still a funny funny movie. And for all of those who ask, yes Spinal Tap came first, but Spinal Tap is not the first spoof movie either. This, in my opinion is equally as funny and in some ways, better than Spinal Tap. As Spinal Tap is to heavy metal, Fear of A Black Planet is to Rap. And the songs are off the hook also. The DVD is chalk full of extras to include music videos of NWH as a group and as solo artists. Brilliant performances by Rusty Condieff and Larry B Scott.|0.256964177424|0.248939691696|0.743035822576
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112471/|Before Sunrise (1995)|My, Kasi Lemmings certainly is a fair looking woman. This film is a lost gem, a dead-on satire mockumentary of the early 90s Hip Hop scene, when MC Hammer had just began to fade away into that good night. We follow the three members of the NWH as they embark upon their picaresque journey of would-be riches and fame. And like Nickolas Nickleby, at the end, they finish their journey not far from where they started, but at least a little wiser and lot less naive. This is one of the best films that no one has ever heard of, but its the kind of film you either love or hate, a lot like Company Man in this regard.

The showing I attended had a sprinkling of African-Americans, and it made the difference in audience-reaction between the two groups a wonderful social commentary on the state of race relations in this country. Basically, the white folks were AFRAID to laugh or laughed nervously at the funny bits --and there are many! -- because theyd be laughting at Blacks, while the Blacks also stayed pretty silent because many couldnt laugh at themselves in front of the whites. <br /><br />I, on the other hand, being Asian (and thus belonging to neither group), had a great time viewing this satire of rap culture and its egos/trappings/values/pseudo-philosophies.

The last movie to see Sandra Locke in a Clint Eastwood movie! An improvement after The Enforcer which was a bit more of a comedy and less serious.

Jennifer Spencer is caught and Harry comes to her rescue during the films climax.

Deadpool was a bit weak in areas too, but I still enjoyed it. This one is one of my favorites of the series, if nothing else for the great line of Go ahead, make my day. This one also features an interesting albeit familiar plot of someone killing those that have done her wrong. Just think Magnum Force with less mystery about who is behind the killings and you have your plot. Granted there is a bit more than that as this one does feature a very nice final showdown at an amusement park. It also features Dirty Harry getting a bulldog as a gift and it tripping up Sandra Locke in a rather humorous scene. The only question that remains is why Clint Eastwood had to have the rather mediocre actress Sandra Locke in so many of his movies. She brings the score down a point every time even when overall the movie is enjoyable to me. Granted she is not to bad here, but her character could have been so much better by someone else. Another problem with this movie and other Dirty Harry movies, at times they almost seem to be advertisements for guns. I like guns as much as the next person, but do we really need scenes of him explaining all the different strengths of his newest weapon and how many bullets it holds?

There werent too many shades of gray with regard to characters or plot. Virtually every character in this film epitomized what is best and worst about our society. The popularity of this film is probably due to the fact that most of us at one time or another have had to deal with scumbags along with the namby-pamby, lily-livered, melee-mouthed bureaucrats that empower them in the name of political correctness. <br /><br />The performances across the board were compelling. I sympathized with the rape victim - while at the same, found it gratifying to see her wipe the smug, vicious arrogance off the faces of her former attackers. In particular, I found the dyke one of the ugliest characters in all of the films Ive seen, so it was nice to see her former victim shut her mouth for good. The lead rapist and psychopath was equally ugly, so it was only fitting that Dirty Harry himself offed him in a loud grotesque fashion in the end.

Refusing to take a vacation he is given a simple case which takes him outside of San Francisco. However, he soon discovers a link between a recent murder in the city and a murder outside of the city, which leads him to the trail of a revenge killer.<br /><br />As an entry in the Dirty Harry franchise the film starts with some very promising moments, including the legendary Go ahead, make my day line that Eastwood delivers wonderfully through clenched teeth before single handedly foiling a robbery. Very badass and it just what fans can expect from him. However, the film soon shifts gears and focuses on the mysterious revenge killer. The problem is that this killer isnt all that mysterious as she is characterized as much as Harry is. This really detracts from the presence of the main character who ruled all of his previous film appearances with, pardon the pun, Magnum Force.<br /><br />On the bright side this new storyline does draw several parallels to Harrys own unorthodox methods and gives his character dramatic depth that was not there before, but fans that were looking for another badass Harry outing will more than likely be somewhat disappointed. However, a tense climax ends the film on an exciting note so if you dont mind something a little different, it is a good movie for fans. --- 7/10<br /><br />Rated R for violence and a rape scene|0.436007232432|0.81230930071|0.563992767568

Although some say that The Enforcer is the best out of the series, I completely disagree. In my opinion, apart from the original Dirty Harry, Sudden Impact and Magnum Force are the only two worthy of being in the series. Although The Enforcer is an alright film with a couple of good action sequences, it doesnt get the dirty and gritty impact that the other three films do. This film captures all the excitement that makes a Clint Eastwood film good, and its got the quotes that make a Dirty Harry film good. In Diry Harry its ..Well do ya, punk?; in Magnum Force A mans got to know his limitations ; and in this its Go ahead. Make my day. Also in this film its nice to see a change of scenery, as you get a bit tired of seeing the same old San Fransisco streets in the other films in the series. With great acting by Clint Eastwood and co-star Sandra Locke, and good directing by Clint, this is in my opinion the best Dirty Harry sequel ever.|0.317454604631|0.104166719132|0.682545395369

Thankfully, this film took some time off to develop a different type of story, one that might reinvent the Dirty Harry and the whole genre.

By the time that The Enforcer rolled around, Dirty Harry was little more than a television cop show (saved only by Tyne Daly). After a break of seven years, Dirty Harry has finally gone back to his roots. Maybe hes been gone for too long this time.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood makes the first well-directed Harry film since Don Siegel made the first, which helps considerably. Harry is a darker character once again, not the nice cop he had become. He can once again say things like Go ahead, make my day and really mean it. Sudden Impact is a true Dirty Harry sequel.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116191/|Emma (1996)|The last film in Lucas saga is a lavish, spectacular-looking production. It is often considered the ugly duckling of the original trilogy, but I think it is a notch above episode IV (and just a notch below episodes III and V). In fact, I think it is the third best film in the 6-part saga. As far as Im concerned, it is still a grandiosely entertaining film. It is not a movie with a beginning, climax and ending; the films mechanism operates with only one goal in its mind: bring closure to Lucas universe. There is an air of finality attached to the whole thing, which makes the film a little too sentimental, but emotionally rewarding. Also, it is a lot of fun. New characters are introduced and old ones face new, unexpected challenges. C3PO and R2D2 provide (as usual) great comic relief. Leia and Solo are a wonderful romantic duo, and Luke is still a great character to identify with. Again, it is Lukes (and Vaders) inner conflict what gives the saga its backbone. Lucas aggressive imagination is still very much apparent, and the films themes of loyalty, hope, and redemption resonate strongly. Im glad Lucas eventually dropped the idea of making episode VII, VIII and IX, because this film is a great bookend to a long, fascinating and captivating saga. Not a perfect movie, but fun in the best matinée style.|0.2463634027|0.170167959418|0.7536365973
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116191/|Emma (1996)|The fourth in the Dirty Harry series, this film features one of the most despicable, ugliest, unlikable, profane, disgusting females I have ever seen on film: Ray Perkins, played by Audrie Neenan. She is the modern nasty low-life version of the 1945 Detour character, Ann Savage.<br /><br />Her foul mouth and gutter attitude turned me off so much I never watched this film again until I acquired a profanity filter which shut her up....and least some of her! Then I could enjoy the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Everywhere Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) goes, violence immediately follows.....within minutes! It happens so often its almost laughable but it makes for a fast-moving, entertaining film with a satisfying ending as all the scumbag villains are eliminated one-by-one.<br /><br />This is a very sophomoric film that appeals to our base instincts.....and connects, sad to say. Most of us like to see these dirtballs get it in the end, and who does it better than Dirty Harry?|0.669200005871|0.12037038961|0.330799994129
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116191/|Emma (1996)|Sudden Impact is the 4th of the Dirty Harry films and one of the best traits of these films is that they dont really degrade in quality from one film to the next. Thus, Sudden Impact provides another thrill ride through the life of Dirty Harry Callahan. This time Harry attempts to solve a series of murders while on vacation. Harrys always on the job it seems. Clint Eastwood plays Harry as he plays all his men of action, slow, deliberate, and without fear. As the first of the Dirty Harry films to be made in the 80s, Sudden Impact lacks a bit of the 70s feel that characterizes the first three films. This doesnt mean that its quality is any less. Bottom Line: Brimming with intensity and action, Sudden Impact is another worthy addition to the Dirty Harry series.|0.275454258671|0.18025447188|0.724545741329

Under these circumstances, no wonder it was a really good thriller, seen when issued and immediately identified with the music. The suspense was flawless, and maintained throughout until the end. Robert Hossein, at the time one of the best European players, managed to impose himself also as a top screen and stage director.

Alexandra Eames, the female detective is rather hard and seems a bit bitter in the Criminal Intent Series. See her other side in this movie.<br /><br />This movie shows the marvelous soft side of this talented actresses and if you are a Criminal Intent fan this movie is a revelry in her acting and you get a pretty darn good yarn of family hardships in the South.<br /><br />I did not like Albert Finneys role in this movie because he did such a convincing acting job of the older Southern fellow that is hard headed and intolerant and unaccepting of change. He reminds me of so many men from my youth and the portrayal is divine, but you will likely find him hard to like in this movie.<br /><br />Katryn Erbe is easy to like in this movie and why I recommend it as a 10 star for Criminal Intent, law and order fans.|0.175466696676|0.155193179362|0.824533303324

Ill echo other reviewers in saying that this movie really does grow on you as you watch. It starts kind of slowly but the way in enfolds is very natural and has a mood to it. You just get into it.<br /><br />I really liked the summery atmosphere to the movie and thought the movie was very touching as a whole. The characters have a strong element of realism and the movie very slowly and gently weaves a spell as you get involved in the various interactions between them all and want to know how it will ultimately turn out and what paths the characters will choose to take. <br /><br />I am very surprised that there are less then a dozen comments on this-there are obscure TV movies that have more comments then Rich In Love.<br /><br />One thing that I will say is I missed the ending which is driving me crazy and I HAVE to watch it again to see that. This is a movie that may not be for everybody but that I feel is strongly underrated(even some of my most film buff purist friends who have seen almost every movie there is havent seen this) and it doesnt even seem to have much of a message board but I liked it a lot and to all those who like family dramas that are warm on scenery, atmosphere and an unhurried languid pace should probably take a look at this. Especially note worthy is that it takes place in South Carolina so for those (like me) who love the south, and movies that take place there, this is a gem.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106582/|Cliffhanger (1993)|Steely, powerful gangster supreme Frankie Diomede (the always terrific Lee Van Cleef in fine rugged form) has himself arrested and sent to prison so he can rub out a traitorous partner sans detection. Fawning goofball small-time hood and wiseguy wannabe Tony Breda (an amiable portrayal by Tony Lo Bianco) gets busted as well. Frank and Tony form an unlikely friendship behind bars. Tony helps Frank break out of the joint and assists him on his quest to exact revenge on a rival group of mobsters lead by the ruthless Louis Annunziata (smoothly played by Jean Rochefort). Director Michele Lupo, working from an absorbing script by Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, relates the neat story at a constant brisk pace, sustains a suitably gritty, but occasionally lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the rousing action set pieces with considerable rip-snorting brio (a roughntumble jailhouse shower brawl and a protracted mondo destructo car chase rate as the definite thrilling highlights). Van Cleef and Lo Bianco display a nice, loose and engaging on-screen chemistry; the relationship between their characters is alternately funny and touching. The ravishing Edwige Fenech alas isnt given much to do as Tonys whiny girlfriend Orchidea, but at least gets to bare her insanely gorgeous and voluptuous body in a much-appreciated gratuitous nude shower scene. Riz Ortolanis groovy, pulsating, syncopated funk/jazz score certainly hits the soulfully swingin spot. The polished cinematography by Joe DAmato and Aldo Tonti is likewise impressive. A really nifty and entertaining little winner.|0.149759229018|0.783924618458|0.850240770982

But this movie has a nice stamp of approval and should deserve a better transfer than what is out there. Stupednous it is not... satisfying it is! Watching this movie I couldnt help to wonder... how come Sergio Martino didnt make this flick? This has his signature all over it and punctuated by Edwedge Fenech (alas not as well known as she should be but she did get a nice cameo in Hostel II). Double-crosses and triple-crosses underly and cement this film from beginning to end with Lee Van Cleef oozing coolness under pressure from the 1st second. Did this guy have to go to Italy to finally reach his potential or did the studio system let this guy slip through? Besides Lees more recognizable films, film-goers should try this on for size and see how if Sergio Leone wouldve lowered his epic scale down on Once Upon a Time in America to half the running time (and 1/4 of the budget) this is what it wouldve turned out to be like. So refreshing, it should be taken in during the day at home and make it for an couch matinée|0.691483318841|0.128552576624|0.308516681159
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106582/|Cliffhanger (1993)|Frankie Dio (Lee VanCleef) is a high-ranking mobster who turns himself in to the police or illegal gambling (for reasons that seem unclear to me). Tony (Tony Lo Bianco) is a low-level thug who frequents a pool hall and spends his free time envying Frankie. By being in the right place at the right time, Tony gets arrested with Frankie and is sent to jail... where they form a bond that may not quite be friendship, but it will do for now.<br /><br />This film came to me under the title of Frank and Tony, which is disappointing because I see an alternate name is Mean Frank and Crazy Tony, which would have helped sell the film more effectively. I presume thats an homage to Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry but what do I know? I watched it shortly after another Italian crime film, Violent Professionals, and I must say the two complement each other very well.<br /><br />Italians have always lagged behind Americans in their budgets and production values, which is a real shame with this film. It is considered a grindhouse film, which unfairly demotes it to a b-movie (or worse). With a cleaner sound and picture, this could have been a Hollywood hit, I suspect. I found the story very interesting, the characters (and actors) better than average and unlike Violent Professionals the plot is fairly clear -- not too many secondary characters.<br /><br />If you like Mafia movies or crime films you should give this one a try. A film about the mob thats actually from Italy (how much more authentic do you want?) is as much as you can ask. Sure, its not The Godfather, but its not supposed to be. This isnt a drama, its a light comedy, heavy action buddy film... like Die Hard With a Vengeance from the point of view of the bad guys. Well, okay, not really.<br /><br />If nothing else, this film made me want to check out other films from the director and the principle cast. Films besides Escape From New York (where VanCleef plays Hauk) and the usual cult movies. Whats more fun than discovering a lost classic?|0.444483486509|0.16301034923|0.555516513491

I believe the minimal sound design and cheap camera is a conscious decision rather than bad film making, Id defend this, the film isnt any worse as a result, and it puts the spotlight on the cast, some of whom are really good (Kate Hardie- think thats her name, as the sarcastic drunk is spot-on) the one exception being David Baddiel, who should never be allowed to appear in serious stuff!!

So, all of them sign a peace treaty and become friends... which isnt going to last for long.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the three become affectionate, patient and kind to each other.

This is not about growing up on Main Street, USA. It is about growing up in Yugoslavia at a time when it was torn between the East and the West. Just like the guys are torn between Esther and everybody else, and Esther is torn between the Tovarish Joe and the guys. There is shame in certain situations that is lost on an audience that has never lived under Tito. I feel the movie is under-rated and it is too bad we have lost the director.

Populated by despicable characters whose depravity knows no bounds, Before The Devil is a mesmerizing, jaw-dropping excursion into perversion which would be laughable (and sometimes is, even with - or perhaps because of - the sickeningly tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout) if it werent carried out with such magnificent, overwhelming conviction by its stars. The excellent script by Kelly Masterson and superb direction by none other than Sidney Lumet doesnt hurt either.<br /><br />The main dysfunction here is of a family nature, with the two majorly screwed up brothers (brilliant portrayals from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) deciding to rob their own parents jewelry store, an attempt that goes pathetically awry.<br /><br />The story is told with time-shifts (which are noted on screen, such as: Charlie: Two Days Before The Robbery, so no one should be confused); some people have said they didnt like this device but I thought it worked perfectly, adding to the skeweredness of the whole affair, considering that the two brothers in question are hardly playing with full decks - between them you couldnt make a decent poker hand to save your life. Throw in these cheesy extra tidbits: one of the brothers is a drug addict, married to Gina (Marisa Tomei, also excellent), who is having an affair with the other brother, toss in some monumental sibling rivalry, along with the fact that said drug addict brother hates his father (a wrenching performance from Albert Finney), who has apparently caused him serious past pain, and youve got a Shakespearean/Greek tragedy on your hands.

At a large family homecoming Dan meets his perfect woman, only to find out that she is in a relationship with his brother.<br /><br />Whats a man to do?<br /><br />I rather liked Dan In Real Life, but I would imagine the success or otherwise of this flick is going to be down to whether you are willing to accept Steve Carell playing a part relatively straight and restrained, rather than going through the broad comedy moves that have made him so successful. If you cannot accept it, fear not, Get Smart will be along later in the year, but for the record I thought he was very good.<br /><br />Dan In Real Life starts off like your typical, incidentally amusing, family drama, but it gets funnier and funnier as it goes along and Carells frustration with his situation grows. Its not massively original (but if you only saw movies with original ideas, cinematic pickings would be very scarce indeed, wouldnt they?), but Dan In Real Life is entertaining, and a good cast (who wouldnt fall in love at first sight with the luminous Juliette Binoche?) make the most of an insightful enough script that contains many a ponder on the meaning and passion of love.<br /><br />I hope that Steve Carell pushes himself and does something as interesting again.|0.25582765368|0.16375522786|0.74417234632

I cant remember laughing so hard at a film and yet being moved by it. The laughs arent gags here--theyre observations, laughs of recognition, little shocks of Oh, my God, I thought I was the only one who felt that way! I wont give away the plot, which is more than just Guy falls in love with his brothers girlfriend. The whole family plays a part in the relationship here. Probably the best blend of laughter and warmth since While You Were Sleeping. <br /><br />Steve Carell goes much deeper than hes gone before, and for the first time I really liked him. The cast is amazing, a list of veteran theater actors whom Ive loved in other roles, but they blend to make a convincing family. Dianne Wiest is lovely as the mother, Juliette Binoche is luminous and hilarious (who knew she was funny?), and even the reviled Dane Cook gives a warm, quiet, touching performance.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109127/|Angels in the Outfield (1994)|The most satisfying element about Dan in Real Life is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) makes sense and is beautifully realistic. The casting of Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche as Dans love interest was a superb decision; she is exceptionally talented, intelligent, naturally attractive and, thank goodness, appropriately aged for the part! Had this movie been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a disaster.<br /><br />Another wonderful aspect about Dan in Real Life is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the frat pack formula: dumb chicks, chauvinistic guys, and sleazy jokes. Dan in Real Life is witty and has fun, intelligent laughs throughout. Whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing, the jokes from Dan in Real Life are more natural and clever, and involve some thinking on the part of the audience.<br /><br />My only problem with Dan in Real Life is that the rebellious, middle daughter is played too outrageously by actress Brittany Robertson. Its difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director. Either way, her character is unrealistic and annoying. But, this is only a minor flaw in the film, and does not take away from the story as a whole.<br /><br />All in all, Dan in Real Life is a great film, a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed-down comedies. The quality of the writing, directing, acting, and (especially) cinematography is excellent. It is simply a beautiful, light-hearted comedy.|0.108635514445|0.135704905078|0.891364485555
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109127/|Angels in the Outfield (1994)|For Romances sake, as a married man. The following two films are recommended.<br /><br />1. Brief Encounter by David Lean (1945), UK<br /><br />Well, when a woman goes to a railway station, something may happen. And it happened! How she longed to be there, in a little tavern waiting for the man of her dreams. But she was married... the man was a stranger to the fantasizing woman<br /><br />2. Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun by Fei Mu (1948), China<br /><br />Well, when a woman goes to the market to buy fish, grocery and medicine, passing through the ruins of an ancient wall in a small town, there is much to think about, about the melancholy of her life, her sick husband in self-pity and lack of future...Just when a jubilant young doctor arrived, something happened... the doctor was a high school honey of the fantasizing woman<br /><br />In both movies, from great directors of UK and China, the passion vs restraint was so intense, yet in the end the intimate feelings had not developed into any physical contacts.

The story is being told slowly but this works out all too well for its build up. The characters are nice and portrayed nicely by its actors. Normally Im not a too big fan of the Asian acting style but the acting in this movie was simply good.<br /><br />Of course the movie is quite different in its approach and style from other genre movies, produced in the west. In a way this movie is more advanced already with its approach than the western movies made during the same era.<br /><br />I only wished the movie its visual style would had been a bit better. For a movie that is considered a kind of an art-house movie this movie is certainly lacking in some well looking sequences. This was obviously a quite cheap movie to make and it got made quite generically. Not that this is a bad thing, it just prevent this movie from truly distinct itself and raising itself above the genre.<br /><br />But oh well, this movie is all about its well constructed story and characters that are in it. In that regard this movie most certainly does not disappoint.<br /><br />8/10|0.395933850891|0.177107279708|0.604066149109

He worked with the cream of the male actors of his day: Gabin, Belmondo, Fernandel, Delon, Sharif, Anthony Quinn. I... comme Icare is the only time he directed Yves Montand. Its an oddly static film, taking place mainly in offices and conference rooms, containing not one chase scene and hardly any violence.<br /><br />Montand gives a good performance, if somewhat dry, and he is well supported by the other actors.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109127/|Angels in the Outfield (1994)|Highly memorable, intelligent and suspenseful movie from one of French movies true geniuses, the formidably able Henri Verneuil. The plot is an exact parallel of the JFK assassination, and takes place in a non-descript, fictional country. The film, visually as well as plot-wise, is razor-sharp. Shot with meticulous precision, it follows Henry Volnay, the Procuror who takes on himself to unravel the coup. In many ways, its a very disturbing movie, not the least for the cold and analytical precision of its comment on a so-called modern states inner workings. The atmosphere and characters are all utterly believable, and Verneuil left nothing to chance in its tight plotting. On another level, this relatively little-known movie just had a 15 years head-start on Oliver Stone, who was acclaimed for the JFK movie, a inferior film in many areas, the least of which not being credibility...<br /><br />Its a masterpiece, any cinema lover should see it, preferably in its original French version with subs.|0.199048160548|0.174610072768|0.800951839452

The story takes place in a fictional state, but obviously it deals with the murder of Kennedy. A truthful and honest district attorney (played by Yves Montand) does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by the single man Daslow (=Oswald) and though all other officials want to close the case he continuous to investigate with his team.<br /><br />The screenplay is written tight and fast and holds the tension till the end. Just the part dealing with the Milgram experiment about authorities is (though not uninteresting) a bit out of place. The ending sequence - explaining who Icarus really is - partly shot in slow motion and intensified by a Morricone soundtrack is the most powerful sequence I have ever seen in a movie.|0.374145350349|0.217613903212|0.625854649651

The resulting huge investigation finds the Lee Harvey Oswald figure of this movie guilty, but one member of the jury insists in further inquiry. He reveals some surprising evidence ...<br /><br />Unlike Oliver Stones JFK - a movie with the same plot - this one does not play with emotions, but concentrates in a exciting description of a conspiracy and how everything fits together, drawing a new picture of the assassination. Even a real psychological experiment is used for this explanation of the crime scene. Compared to JFK this movie is more reasonable, intelligent and thrilling. Parts of the plot can be found in a lot of newer movies, I had a kind of deja vu sometimes sitting in the cinema.<br /><br />I... comme Icare is a must see.

The co-ordination of the action sequences are laughable and make the film have some funny slap stick moments. Robert Ginty and Fred Williamson have a memorable scene together near the end, where Williamson says to Ginty, you sure do get around buddy boy!. I did enjoy this film only for Ginty and Williamson, but not for the storyline that must have been written on the back of a napkin in four lines and the rest ad-libbed most likely. A film with over 30 parts only has a credit list for 10 or so. It seems odd that no one else has a credit in the film, maybe they had some insight into how the finished product would look. The one thing this film does have going for it is that it is quite violent, so that tripled with Fred Williamson and Robert Ginty make for a film worth seeing.|0.632526804895|0.112963416535|0.367473195105

He claimed its one of the funniest and coolest low budget actioners ever made. I generally dont watch movies knowing that theyre going to be bad, but I made an exception for this one... and I was very glad that I did.<br /><br />Its filled to the brim with action (much of it surprisingly, graphically gory), sleaze (isolated to nudity with a key female character, but theres so much of it in one scene that it becomes hilarious) and outrageously awkward dialogue, all of which adds to the laughter-inducing tone of the film.<br /><br />Ginty, the unusual looking star of THE EXTERMINATOR (and countless other low budget action turds) is amusing in the lead, giving the best performance he could muster. Williamson is better than usual, clearly hamming it up with unparalleled glee (and he doesnt come in until midway through). The rest of the cast is also fun to watch, particularly the villains, one of whom is a sadistic sexpot who speaks with an accent that appears to be a mish-mash of Spanish and Italian. Shes priceless.<br /><br />Again, I cant stress enough how gory it was. Its not so bloody that its nauseating, but its uncommonly violent in parts with some meaty squibs going off in the shootouts and it has a grueling torture sequence that no man will soon forget. Also, when Ginty is being swarmed by a pack of bad guys, he conveniently gets a hold of a chainsaw and the splatter moments that follow will have any and all action fans cheering and spilling their beers.<br /><br />Dont miss WHITE FIRE.

Mathieu has a complex relationship with his ill mother, demanding aunt and sister (with whom he has a competitive relationship). Soon, the two are falling in love.<br /><br />The films fractured narrative -- which is comprised of lengthy flash-backs, bits and pieces of the present, and real-time forward-movement into the future -- is a little daunting. Director Sebastien Lifshitz doesnt signal which time-period we are in, and the story line can be difficult to follow.

But the absence of conventional dramatic tension counts for less than it might in a world so subtly drawn.

And after reading comments from all the other posters here, and thinking about it some more, I decided that I liked it tremendously. I love American films - probably because they are so narrative. They usually have a well-defined beginning, middle, and end. Presque rien, on the other hand, makes no such attempt. I disagree with other posters that say its too artsy. In every way, this film is meant to evoke your sense memories. So often throughout the film you feel like youre there... you feel the summer sun, the breezes, the heat, the winter chill, the companionship, the loneliness, etc., etc.<br /><br />In every way, the director pulls you into the lives of the characters - which is why so many people feel so strongly that the movie disappointed them.

Midler, who has been performing live on stage since the 1970s, proves that she is still one of the most electrifying live performers in the business. From her opening number, her classic Friends, where she descends from the wings atop a beautiful prop cloud, Bette commands the stage with style and charisma from a rap-styled number called I Look Good she then proves that she has a way with a joke like few other performers in this business as she segues her way through a variety of musical selections. The section of the show where she salutes burlesque goes on a little too long but she does manage to incorporate her old Sophie Tucker jokes here to good advantage (even though she actually forgets one joke in the middle of telling it, but her ad-libbing until she remembers it is hysterical). Bette also treats us to Roses Turn from GYPSY and the title tune from her smash film THE ROSE as well as a shameless plug for her hit movie THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. She brings the house down near the end with Stay with Me, Baby from THE ROSE and her only #1 hit record, Wind Beneath My Wings from BEACHES.

I read the play before I saw the movie and loved them both. Its the story of a young man preparing to leave Ireland to go to America because he cant earn a living in Ireland. It is told both from the perspective of the young man(whom the other characters in the film can see) and another young man representing his uncensored thoughts and feelings., but who cannot be seen by the other characters in the film. It is a very sad movie, but deeply touching, and I would recommend this film to anyone who wants something to think about. I love any Irish movie, or almost any movie about Ireland, and any film that has the late Irish actor Donal McCann in it gets my vote.I would watch that man chew gum for 2 hours on screen, and unfortunately,I have.Terrible shame to have lost him so young.|0.325146314287|0.203551060808|0.674853685713

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025586/|Of Human Bondage (1934)|I know, I know: its childish. But I just love this type of movie. A bird that suffered a lot of mishaps and still hasnt lost his faith in humanity and his sense of humor. Whats special about this film is the fact that the main character is Paulie -the parrot- and hes not used as a boost to some hotshot human actor. Furthermore I like the storyline: Paulie tells his lifestory to a cleaner at the point he hit rock bottom. (By the way: Jay Mohrs voice almost sounds like Joe Pescis!). And Cheech Marin of course, the man IS humor to me. Ever since I saw Up in Smoke I have appreciated his naive way of performing, making a simple situation a hilarious one.. cant help myself.|0.463767365651|0.153265624118|0.536232634349
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025586/|Of Human Bondage (1934)|Paulie sounds like the most saccharine, lachrymose and sentimental garbage you could ever find, yet its actually much better than you might expect. The daftness of the plot could so easily have set the tone for the whole film, but actually in most other departments the film is charming.<br /><br />In case youre wondering, Paulie is a parrot. Bought for a little girl with speech difficulties, Paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her. He even sits on her shoulder during speech therapy lessons, and eventually becomes a super-intelligent speaker himself. However, Paulie is sent away by the little girls mother and he spends the rest of the film trying to get from N.Y.C to L.A to be re-united with her.<br /><br />So, why does this awful-sounding film succeed relatively well? Firstly, it boasts some interesting and impressive animatronic effects. Secondly (and far more significantly) it has the courage to embrace its ludicrous premise and tells a genuinely moving, often humourous story without worrying too much about the obvious flaws in the storyline. Thirdly, it has several surprisingly strong performances, including Jay Mohr as a wily crook, Gena Rowlands as a kind old lady, and Cheech Marin (yes, the dope-smoking Cheech Marin!) as a musical immigrant. It might not be a classic, but Paulie is sound entertainment for kids of all ages.|0.463802453276|0.171590938363|0.536197546724

Actually,I had just gotten back home from being out and turned on the TV and there it was,Paulie. <br /><br />I had missed the opening credits,so I didnt know the name of it but I saw that it had Cheech Marin in it,so I naturally thought I had tuned into Born In East L.A. When I saw him talking to a talking parrot,I was ready to dismiss this as the kind of flop movie they show late in the night.<br /><br />Happy to say,it was better than that. As you know,if you dont already Paulie is lost and trying to get back to his original owner. Seems its taken years to find her. What should be Paulies advantage is actually a dis-advantage in ways. People come across a literate parrot and all they see is a way to make money or benefit themselves. <br /><br />While Cheech Marins character is making money from him,hes not mean to him. The dance sequences with the parrots are something kids will find cute,I found them amusing.<br /><br />Paulie,whos naive,learns quickly that not all humans are nice people. Especially the owner of an animal research lab. The man lies to him saying hell help him find his owner as long as he helps in his animal communications research. Paulie is now stuck but decides to make a fool out of the man at a demonstration to others of Paulies vocal ability.<br /><br />Throughout the film Paulies telling his story to the facilities janitor who ends up freeing him,several other animals and finding the location of Paulies owner. Its a touching reunion. <br /><br />8 out of 10,the wing clipping scene should have been assumed and not shown. That part might bother younger children.

I bet the only truth to it was there was an ex-model turned bounty hunter possibly named Domino.<br /><br />Anyways, it begins with Domino talking to Lucy Liu, who works for the FBI. Domino is being interrogated about what she knows about a theft of 10 million dollars. Through flashbacks, we see Domino as a child, then as a model, and how she became interested in being a bounty hunter. She basically tells 2 other bounty hunters off, Ed and Choco. They let her join the group. Shes tough, can use any kind of weapon, and will use her good looks if needed.<br /><br />They get involved with a scam that Clarmont, a bailsman, has going. Along the way, the group starts a reality TV show, and thats where Ian Zering and Brian Austin Green become involved. They are sort of like hosts and must have been really desperate to appear in this.<br /><br />I thought the story was entertaining and it had some laughs. The editing didnt bother me. Theres also a lot of violence, mainly using guns, and blood. It could have been a little shorter.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Good enough to watch.|0.456589777666|0.792181968806|0.543410222334

There are good actors in this film, for instance Doug Hutchison (Percy from The Green Mile), who plays Bristol. Another well known actor is Jamie Kennedy, from Scream and Three Kings. The main characters are played by Jamie Foxx as Alvin, who was pretty good and also funny, but the one who most surprised me, was David Morse as Edgar Clenteen. He plays a different character than he usually does, because in other films like The Green Mile, Indian Runner, The Negotiator or The Langoliers he plays a very sympathetic person, and in Bait the plays almost the opposite, a man without any emotions, which was nice to see. The only really negative thing about this film, are the several pictures of the World Trade Center, which makes this film perhaps look a little dated.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119906/|Playing God (1997)|If you go to this movie expecting something it isnt, you will be disappointed, as with any movie. This movie contains what Hemmingway described as the iceberg effect. On the surface, its simply a cache of random movie clips smashed together to make a movie. If this would be written in a book, it would be a short story, because the action in the movie is very fast paced, and unless you actually try to catch it, the reasoning behind the plot (along with some subtle foreshadowing) can very well pass you by. Definitely a movie you will have to see twice in order to fully appreciate. Experimental Cinematography barely describes this movie. The camera-work and post production add much to the overall flavour of the film, making it quite artistic at some points and open to interpretation at others (something to be desired in American movies as of late). Although, at some parts it may get a little raunchy, gruesome and too heavy for some audiences, the movie never becomes completely unrealistic. The only aspect of the movie that I would write off as needs improvement is the soundtrack selection. No movie is ever good without a fitting soundtrack, and although the soundtrack is quite fitting, the opening is a little too long, and the other rap songs in the film really could have been replaced with something more appropriate (heavy, grungy rock or psychedelic electronica would have made this film a real trip). The flooding of imagery and dynamic... color palettes adds another artistic aspect to it, also combined with the events that happen throughout the film, this is not a movie you can miss any part of and still understand. However, that also makes it much more of a desirable film to watch, and not one youll quickly get bored of. 8.5/10|0.527505716602|0.145300300301|0.472494283398

And any actor that makes me forget who they are has done their job well. Not once did I think of Kiera in a soccer uniform or pirate costume.

Playback}<br /><br />Never have I seen a director take so much flack for his style before. By now it is evident that most people do not appreciate Tony Scotts choppy, flashy, dizzying editing technique. If I have to choose between loving it and hating it, Id say I love it. It was borderline distracting at times, but the end result was pretty good and its nice to see a director with a creative edge to his style and some originality (even if it borrows heavily from MTV videos).<br /><br />This stylistic edge manifests itself as Keira Knightley plays the role of cocky badass bounty hunter Domino Harvey and even her dialogue seems strangely choppy. Otherwise she plays her poorly because I pretty much hated her character and did not sympathize one bit with her, no matter how much she suffered. We follow Domino through her life as she joins up with fellow bounty hunters Mickey Rourke, Rizwan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez. The crew become tangled up in the FBI and suddenly has a reality show contract under Christopher Walkens TV production company (what is Christopher Walken doing in every film, by the way?). I guess that is a clever film technique, because now Tony Scott is free to use as much flashy MTV/Reality Show editing footage as he likes. It becomes a pastiche of MTV culture at this point.<br /><br />It followes then that the story is told at an amazingly rapid-fire pace, with lots of raunchy strong language and gun violence. There are some funny jokes; its all very modern and surreal at the same time. Its a mess, but its a rather enjoyable mess. It is ultimately flawed in so many ways (the actors try too hard to make their characters cool, for one) but it works.

A supposed thriller borrowing from A Time to Kill, Silence of the Lambs, even an inverted In the Heat of the Night with a little reverse murder, a la Strangers on a Train thrown in, it fails abysmally where all the above, to a large degree, succeeded. Namely, in delivering thrills. The plot seems condensed from a bigger book, making the plot developments obvious and uninvolving, while the direction lacks pace and verve. To rein in any kudos, a major twist had to be delivered along the way and here it fails palpably too. Connery is clearly slowing down in his old age, barely bothering with his attempt at a US accent and besides seems too old to be the husband of Hope Lange and the father of those gosh - darn kids of his. He even has a father in law who seems younger than him. Laurence Fishburne barely gets the chance to inhabit his role and youre confused from the outset as to whether hes a bad guy or a good guy. Someone once said that flashbacks shouldnt lie - they do, confusedly, here. The rest of the playing is merely average by a reasonable cast in their underwritten stereotyped roles. The supposed climax managed too, to roll by leaving me firmly entrenched in the back, not as should have been the aim, front edge of my seat.

Its more an accident than a screenplay and may be good for examination purposes at screen-wrights schools. The more you remind the details the stronger this impression gets.

We think that this movie is going to be about something with Connerys conviction against capitol punishment in the beginning but it turns out to be nothing but a standard, contrived for the audiences sake, run of the mill, lets never get it over with, thriller. We are pulled into every silly switch in character, as they are portrayed to us when its needed in the story, and were ready for this thing to be over way before it ends.

However before that it suffers from predictability and a stunningly vapid performance by Kate Capshaw, who clearly never found her character and ruins every scene shes in. Connery is fine as is Fishbourne, but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth which overlays the entirety with a sense of unreality. And the ending is simply bizarre. The film makers apparently knew when they pieced this mess together that all they needed were sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to have Thanksgiving dinner, so to compensate they added an overloud dramatic score. Every little jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration, to the point where it becomes laughable.

I refuse to spoil the film, but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning just could not be he whom we see at the end.<br /><br />The second major disappointment of the film is that--finally, it becomes little more that a bloody slasher film. There is little qualitative difference between this and one of the Friday the 13th films. Not that every film need always be totally tasteful, but this film does drip gore on occasion.<br /><br />Though the film features the magnificent Sean Connery, even he does not measure up to his usual standard, and often just seems to be walking through the paces.|0.352732419804|0.346298664519|0.647267580196
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113501/|Just Cause (1995)|Ive seen my fair share of badly thought-out endings and final twists to films, but I dont recall any film that committed outright suicide like this one did.<br /><br />The film makers were clearly hoping that the great twist would surprise us all.... and it did, but perhaps not in the way the directors had hoped. I was left feeling surprised that Connery, Harris, Fishburn and Capshaw had anything to do with this turkey, individually or collectively.<br /><br />The film up until the final thirty minutes was rather engaging and I like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film overall. But once the twist was revealed, the plot holes and inconsistencies were remarkable, the underlying motive for revenge was ill-conceived and the ways things so neatly worked out for Bobby Earl was ridiculously far-fetched. Whats worse is that, once the twist was revealed, the remainder of the film became excruciatingly predictable.<br /><br />Harris gave a terrific performance and Connery is like Morgan Freeman in that he never gives a bad performance, even if the movie aint that great! So all in all, it starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested. The last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable nose dives in the history of cinema.|0.715595753148|0.116013071904|0.284404246852

Rather than take viewers back, this movie should just embarrass anyone who was a scene-ster in the early 90s.<br /><br />The idea that a fifty year old woman envies a bunch of self-absorbed kids from a different era is the world as only self-absorbed, twenty-somethings could imagine it.

He was a fine actor until Scent of a Woman, where he apparently overdosed on himself irreparably. I hoped this film, of which Id heard almost nothing growing up, would be a nice little gem. An overlooked, ahead-of-its-time, intelligent and engaging city-political thriller. Its not.<br /><br />City Hall is a movie that clouds its plot with so many characters, names, and realistic citywide issues, that for a while you think its a plot in scope so broad and implicating, that once you find out the truth, it will blow your mind. In truth, however, these subplots and digressions result ultimately in fairly tame and very familiar urban story trademarks such as Corruption of Power, Two-Faced Politicians, Mafia with Police ties, etc. And theoretically, this setup allows for some thrilling tension, the fear that none of the characters are safe, and anything could happen! But again, it really doesnt.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the only things that happen are quite predictable, and were left with several confession monologues, that are meant as a whole to form modern a fable of sorts, a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the real world of politics and society. But after 110 minutes of names and missing reports and a spider-web of lies and cover-ups, the audience is usually treated to a somewhat satisfying reveal. I dont think were left with that in City Hall, and while its a very full film, I dont find it altogether rich.|0.418977980305|0.159991730631|0.581022019695

But it not only fails to deliver, it brings up nauseous self righteous preaching at the same time.<br /><br />John Cusack is even flatter than he was in Midnight of the Garden of Good and Evil. The difference is that this time he is supposed to have an southern accent, which he noticeably loses several times each scene.<br /><br />Al Pacino does his shtick but seems to be walking through this film and collecting a paycheck. Hes good as usual but hardly standout.<br /><br />Supporting cast -- throw in female romantic interest which added little, if anything, to the story. Speaking of the story, a convoluted who really cares tale where Cusack is the self-righteous Mayors boy who just has to search for the right thing to be done.<br /><br />People dont act this way. Cusacks character loses all credibility at the end, of which without revealing it, is preach and nauseous. The final scene makes the penultimate silliness seem profound. Its also completely inaccurate but I wont get into law.<br /><br />This is a bad, by the numbers movie.

I bought the DVD recently, and upon a second viewing I wondered why I liked it. The acting was awful, and as usual we have the stereo-typical clansmen in their fake costumes. The acting was awful at best. Tim Roth did an OK job as did Liam Neeson, but Ive no idea what Jessica Lange was thinking.<br /><br />The plot line was good, but the execution was just poor. Im tired of seeing Scotland portrayed like this in the films. Braveheart was even worse though, which is this films only saving grace. But seriously, people didnt speak like that in those days, why do all the actors have to have Glaswegian accents? Just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes. I notice the only people on here who say this film is good are the Americans, and to be honest I can see why theyd like it, I know they have an infatuation for men in Kilts.

This movie was supposed to be about vengeance for crimes committed against a culture, but it ended up being a petty bar-brawl. And there was only one of them who actually knew what a sword was; Tim Roths character (and yes, he plays him well). Rob Roy was a weak hero with no knowledge of how to use a sword, and the way he won was a disgrace.

I expected a drama with more intense character development. But that never happens in the movie. Daniel-Day Lewis is a good actor, but not as good as some reviewers here would have us believe. I tought he repeated the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the movie. I would rate his performance 6 out of 10.<br /><br />Acting: 6 out of 10 Direction is 5 out of 10. Script is the worst: 2 out of 10. <br /><br />I deleted the movie from my DVR at 70 mins. into the movie. Much better movies out there than this...|0.799672897204|0.14090910069|0.200327102796
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097937/|My Left Foot (1989)|So I finally saw the film My Left Foot last night after years of being told by my mother how amazing it is... The central performance of Day-Lewis is indeed remarkable and amazing, but anyone with even minimal exposure to his other work should expect nothing less.<br /><br />The fatal misjudgement in my eyes was that in becoming obsessed with proving the normalcy of this man; the movie chose to show him as a complete and utter jerk. On the one hand I can see that this is a logical correlation; mankind always has the capacity to be objectionable, and disability shouldnt obscure that. I just wish that impartial onlookers wouldnt be so forgiving of aberrant behaviour and assume that circumstances automatically make it forgivable. They dont. Acting out is normal, and so yes, disabled people act out - but they dont do it because theyre disabled; they do it because theyre being unreasonable. A physical impairment doesnt afford you the right to throw a hissy fit in public, just because someone you love turns you down.<br /><br />There are certain things it is unwise to do whether you are disabled or able-bodied. Giving someone tacit permission to boot a football directly at your head for the sole purpose of fitting in is one of them. (Admittedly, I did once save a penalty from the schools star striker with my face, but I already belonged by then. It wasnt for acceptance.) Engaging in a bar brawl is another. Revelling in the fact that your father only extends companionship to you after youve proved yourself capable of metaphorically jumping through physical hoops takes masochism a step too far. All of these things are stupid, and suffering through them as a way to demonstrate your bravery doesnt make them any less foolhardy.<br /><br />So yes; just because youve overcome obstacles to achieve great things doesnt make you any less of a jerk... Being a good person takes priority; setting an inspiring example for the disabled should appear way down the list.|0.435140162175|0.176325687434|0.564859837825

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114007/|Nothing Personal (1995)|I disliked this film intensely and left during the scene where the loyalist gang are shot up by the British. The film effectively blames the people of NI as being the cause of their own troubles. It suggests that the 25 year war was a question of intransigence and nothing to do with Britains partition of Ireland and domination of its history i.e. NI was created by Britain in 1921 irrespective of the wishes of the rest of Ireland.<br /><br />The characters are portrayed as hapless fools, even though I despise loyalist paramilitaries they were fighting for a cause - maintaining their artificial privileges over the Catholic community. It is a known fact that British Intelligence collaborated with loyalists during the war, no doubt to keep the Catholics at bay and demoralise republicanism.<br /><br />Nineties values about machismo, masculinity etc are transposed on to 1970s Belfast and are portrayed as part of the supposedly unique Irish psyche which leads to violence. The stupid song from the woman in the club - old Ireland of green fields ..blah..blah.. - is given a symbolic stature, i.e. poor young fools fighting for an impossible cause.

However, the film bogs down fairly early on with some very dumb dialog as the males all try to flirt with Anne Francis Altaira Morbius.)<br /><br />Viewing this in the 90s after a long absence, it was fun to see Francis again, an actress who has done mostly television shows since this film was released....and is still acting. It also was interesting to see a young-looking Leslie Nielsen (Dr. John J. Adams), who I wouldnt have recognized had it not been for this voice <br /><br />I watched half of this movie before the boredom came almost overwhelming and I had a strong desire to go to sleep. I appreciated them re-doing this VHS tape in stereo. but it was a weak effort. This is one those overrated film where elites think is so heavy and thought-provoking. Thats nonsense.

No argument that her talent is apparent and her performance excellent. I guess I can also see how the professional critics liked the aesthetic content of the story. However, I like to think that movies are meant to entertain us and that is where this movie fails.<br /><br />By the halfway point, I found myself thinking, How much longer do we have to watch a bored shop girl, idly standing around a deserted souvenir shop, rearranging the merchandise? It seemed to go on forever!<br /><br />Then, I thought, maybe this is one of those movies where the director tries to lull the audience into a relaxed state before hitting them with some dynamic event. No such luck. The movie continues its bland, boring, uneventful story all the way to the end.<br /><br />Im not saying this because Im an action-junkie.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106834/|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993)|I couldnt believe how lame & pointless this was. Basically there is nothing to laugh at in the movie, hardly any scenes to get you interested in the rest of the movie. This movie pulled in some huge stars but they were all wasted in my opinion. I think Keanu Reeves mustve taken some acting lessons a fews years after this movie before he stared in The Matrix. Uma Thurman looked very simple & humble. Luckily i got this movie for a very low price because its certainly not a movie to remember for any good reasons. I wont write anything about the story of the movie, but as you should know that she is meant to be the most famous hitchhiker across America because of her huge thumb. I would give this movie a 2 / 10. Before I watched this movie I was wondering why this movie has only got a 4.0/10, & now I know why. A very disappointing movie.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106834/|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993)|No one should ever try to adapt a Tom Robbins book for screen. While the movie is fine and the performances are good, the dialogue, which works well reading it, is crap when spoken. Or, to put it another way, no one would be likely to suggest that hearing someone elses name was like seeing it written in radium on a pearl.<br /><br />Overall, the movie feels like a badly-adapted Cliffs Notes to the book - most of the parts have been hacked down to a fifth of their size in the book, in terms of backstory and current story, and the ending is wildly (and unpleasantly) different from that of the book. Most of the plots from the book have gotten lost, including the one that makes everything make sense at the end, and theres more than one reference that makes sense in the book that makes the viewer say Huh? Not a worthy effort, unfortunately - the script should have been read, compared to the book, burned, and all the actors sent off to do something far better. I admire Gus Van Sant tremendously, but not even someone of his calibre could have made a decent movie of such a complex book without making a miniseries.|0.613528757542|0.130092592596|0.386471242458
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106834/|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993)|Uma Thurman plays Sissy, a young woman with a gypsy spirit (and freakishly large thumbs) who hitchhikes cross-country, eventually finding her true place amongst a group of peyote-enlightened cowgirls on a ranch devoted to preserving the Whooping Crane; Rain(bow) Phoenix is their lesbian leader, Bonanza Jellybean, who falls in love with Sissy, thumbs or not. Gus Van Sant directed and adapted Tom Robbins book, but his satire has no primary target and just skitters all over the map, like Sissy (maybe that was his goal, but its not involving for an audience). Notorious box-office flop wasnt so much panned as it was ignored, and one can see why: its a series of sketches in search of a plot, and the performances, directorial touches and cinematography are all variable. Thurman is a stitch posing alongside the highway trying to get a ride, but this pretty much put the kibosh on Phoenixs career. Writer Buck Henry (who didnt write this, but perhaps should have) gives the most assured performance as the doctor who works on one of those thumbs.<br /><br />Two thumbs down.|0.18442069775|0.835641266032|0.81557930225
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106834/|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993)|I absolutely love all of Tom Robbins books, so I was very excited and interested to see a movie made after one of his books. I knew that there would be no way that the movie would capture even half of Robbins magic, but after seeing the movie, it made me never want to read the book again. The movie Even Cowgirls Get the Blues doesnt include an eighth of the content in the book, and it seems to focus more on the love connection between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else. Along with the incredibly weak plot line in the movie, I think that better actors definitely could have been chosen to play the characters. The only actors in the movie that I thought played their roles fit to Robbins descriptions in the book were Julians friends, in their five minute clip in the beginning of the movie. Those who havent read the book might enjoy the movie, but as a huge Tom Robbins fan, this movie was nothing but a disappointment.|0.557845983484|0.118518534095|0.442154016516
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106834/|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993)|I love movies. I love independent efforts and major studio productions. I love films with stars and I love those featuring unknowns. I love dramas, comedies, action-adventures, science fiction, mysteries, westerns, any genre except horror. I love foreign films as well as those in English. I love good movies and I even love bad ones, because almost no film ever fails to entertain or amuse on some level. Except for Even Cowgirls Get the Blues.<br /><br />When I attended a late-night showing of Cowgirls, I joined an audience of around 10. Less than halfway into it, I alone remained. Soon not even I could tolerate the disturbing mess unfolding before my eyes, and I left as well. To this day Cowgirls remains the only movie I have ever walked out of.<br /><br />I dont quite know how to describe this incoherent, vacuous, trashy, meaningless film, or how to adequately convey its lack of redeeming value. Suffice to say that it ranks as one of the worst major films of all time, preposterous and inexcusable on every level. It tries to be clever, but its conception of feminism seems hopelessly anachronistic. It tries to be funny, but its humor is coarse and cringe-worthy. This is one of the few films which manages to profane its own ethos, by depicting protagonists in so off-putting a manner that you revolt against them and their values. If you want to watch a movie, watch Waterworld, Ishtar, anything but this. Except for the new Alexander.

Maybe wed missed something... nope, whats missing was missed from the beginning of preproduction. I actually went back to Robbins novel to see if I could find the problem, and I discovered that what I thought was funny and exciting back in the day is now just so much disconnected and fuzzy-headed junk.<br /><br />So, the initial problem with the film was deciding to do it at all, and the rest of the train wreck progressed from there. Absolutely nothing works - not a blessed thing. Some beautiful exterior photography gets steamrolled by random camera placement in interior shots. All of the actors look at least uncomfortable - Angie Dickenson looks positively mortified - except for Rain Phoenix, who gives the impression that she is too unaware to realize how awful her performance really is. The dialog is one, long, unwavering cringe. Scenes dont make sense from second to second, and the connections between them are nonexistent. And yet, the movie stumbles blindly on, convinced that it is saying something profound.<br /><br />This is too bad to even be funny; it is simply excruciating. Gus Van Zant has done other good-to-great movies which I encourage you to see, and Im happy he survived (and appears to have learned from) this mess.|0.867047077343|0.166402134784|0.132952922657

Its basically meant to be Spinal Tap with a hip hop theme, but it fails miserably. It consistently feels like it was written and acted by high-school kids for some school project, and thats also the level the humor seems to be aimed at. There is no subtlety and, more damningly for a mockumentary, it never once feels like a documentary. And while the lines arent funny in the first place, an attempt at dead-pan delivery would have helped -- certainly, anything would be better than the shrill overacting we are subjected to.<br /><br />Id recommend this to people who like comedies in the vein of Big Mommas House or Norbit; people who think that words like butt are inherently hysterically funny.

To get Ryan to like Robbins, Einstein tries to make Robbins look like a brilliant scientist. The idea is cute, but the film falls flat with corny situations and silly dialogue. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, and the terrific supporting cast do their best to keep this silly comedy afloat, but are unable to rescue the film.

Although hes on-screen much of the time, Robbins cancels out the inner-workings of his intense persona and fades into the background (its easy to forget hes even in the picture!). Lumpy romantic comedy with a gimmick, that being Walter Matthau playing Einstein (who does what he can with a cartoonishly conceived character). Otherwise, its sugary and sunny, directed rather drowsily by Fred Schepisi, who shows heart but no wit or brains. Meg Ryan is her usual affable self and the chemistry between she and Robbins is charming, like that of an affectionate sister and her big brother. ** from ****|0.319651184294|0.487495087858|0.680348815706
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110099/|I.Q. (1994)|When I first saw this film, I thought it should have come from the childrens section - Its very fun and at times humorous, and is actually quite a good story, but it severely lacks the romantic chemistry that actors like Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins are capable of delivering. I must note that Walter Matthau is perfect for the part of Albert Einstein, and his performance is extraordinary, but thats the sole exception. This film appears a bit forced, the directing lacks substance, and oh yeah...the music is ridiculously awful, it didnt put me in a very good mood. But if you are not expecting a smart, well-crafted comedy/romance tale, then this certainly can be entertaining, like I said..it should be in the childrens section. Einstein and his buddies are a good relief from Tim Robbins boring, almost tense quest to steal Meg Ryans heart.

Ice Cubes character is the epitome of an instigating black man that was responsible for most of the violence in this film. Singleton barely touched on the relationships between the white and black characters that were trying to reach out to each other. When Omar Epps says  I need to be with my people, that racist remark spoke volume.

I agree universities are not bastions of tolerance like they are supposed to be and the title would be fitting if Singleton didnt make his characters such broad caricatures.<br /><br />On the surface he tries to portray Ice Cubes character as a bad guy, provoking Remy to become a racist skinhead. But who graduates at the end in the movies redeeming epilogue? It seems Singleton points at white as either unable to empathize (I didnt say sympathize!) with his fellow black student OR only able to take the path of a racist skinhead. Many people who have been bullied by people of another race do not turn to extreme bigotry.<br /><br />Nor do women who have been raped immediately turn to lesbianism, which is portrayed more as a cult than a lifestyle.

The low point of the movie is the peace rally, in which the symbols of the 1960s free love movement are reappropriated for what much more closely resembles a Take Back The Night rally with live, stridently identity-conscious musical acts in tow. Perhaps in his prim revisionism the director was trying to assert that identity politics is the new Vietnam? Ooh, how Adrienne Rich of himand Remys firing into the crowd is a nice touch, if youre into Richs sort of political posturing.<br /><br />I wish I could give this movie negative stars. I can recommend it only to those interested in the 1990s as history, a time when radical feminists brought the academic trinity of race, class, and gender to popular culture and declared man-hating a viable and honorable POLITICAL option.

However, i have to say this was a major disappointment and is everything i hate about contrived, clichéd, so-called message movies. <br /><br />The acting is mainly poor,(pop stars and models do NOT necessarily make good actors...take note), the situations hard to swallow, (rape victim becomes overnight lesbian?...please!), but worst of all it reinforces every screwed up stereotype you can think of. By the second half of the film it has become cartoon like in its characterisation, making you lose any shred of empathy you may have had for its one-dimensional players.<br /><br />Not once is any valid point made about the inherent causes of racism and cultural, sexual and political ignorance. As a result it merely ends up sensationalising the results of these problems. Its message is contradictory, resulting in a sense of confusion and a general lack of plot cohesion. As for the films conclusion i found it predictable, embarrassing, exploitative and mildly offensive. For a film called Higher Learning i have to say all i learned is to avoid seeing this ever again.<br /><br />If you want a true comment on some of the themes that this film completely fails to elaborate upon then go hire American History X....unless you were just watching it for Tyra Banks then go hire a life.|0.682775780773|0.17581018528|0.317224219227

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113305/|Higher Learning (1995)|Yes, people are racist. People are even racist in college. Thats a good point, and the issue of racism has been dealt with many times before in countless films. What sets Higher Learning apart from the pack is that it deals with the issue of racism in the most ham-fisted and predictable way possible, oh yeah its in college too.<br /><br />This film deals with this problem of racism the way Frankenstein deals with most problems, it bashes you over the head repeatedly in a brutal and sluggish manner. Most of the characters are cartoonish, one-dimensional, caricatures (lesbian feminist, angry black man), that react to situations as dramatically and predictably as possible. Instead of defying stereotypes this film is overpopulated with them. The angry black men feel cheated, feminists hate men, etc. (one feminist even holds a sign that reads Dead Men Dont Rape. See what I mean?) I dont want to give anything away, but in this movie if someone seems like a shifty loner or a date rapist theyll probably behave exactly how you expect them to. The changes the characters go through seems obvious to everyone but the people in the movie. The big twist in the plot hinges on whether or not the violent neo-Nazis will act like violent neo-Nazis. Ill guess youll just have to watch to find out what happens.<br /><br />Another problem I have with this movie is that its supposed to be gritty and hard-hitting, but they make Nazis the bad guys. I agree Nazis are evil, but thats my point. Everybody thinks Nazis are bad; were not breaking any new ground here. Nazis have been portrayed as villains since the 1930s. The film doesnt challenge any viewpoints or make bold statements. It just deals with issues we all know about in a clumsy, after-school-special like, manner. Being anti-rape, anti-racist, and anti-Nazi isnt exactly taking a hard stance on a controversial issue.<br /><br />Higher Learning is predictable, cartoonish, and in a word stupid.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113305/|Higher Learning (1995)|This movie masquerades as a social commentary, when in fact it is every bit as ridiculous as the very racism it condemns. The premise of this movie: African-American = Strong... any other race = weak. The worst part is when Rapaport pulls a gun on Omar Epps and a Jewish guy. The Jewish guy, in stereotypical fashion, crumbles in fear and starts pleading for his life... but the big, strong, defiant Omar Epps stands strong with no fear. We also have the condemnation of every fraternity member as being a arrogant preppie drunk or rapist. The raped white girl, of course, begins considering lesbianism since shes just a weak white girl after all. When the nerdy white guy is rejected by the fraternity members he of course must fall in with the skinheads, who are incredible cowards; especially the big muscular guy who is beaten down quickly by the strong black men. Wait... BUSTA RHYMES BEAT UP A GUY TWICE HIS SIZE??? Yeah, right.<br /><br />Of course the black men NEVER reject their own people and Omar Epps moves in with them easily. The scenes where Ice Cube threatens his white roommates and keeps them in line are just stupid -- of course he is the dominating one while his weak white roommates sit in fear of him and eventually move out. This movie was just terrible and the ending made me actually laugh out loud. The overly long slow-motion between Epps and Banks gets hilarious with the faces they make -- its like watching my nephew and cousins making faces at each other (and theyre all under 5).

Not a bad way to spend a couple of hours if you want to see him in his tighty-whities -- its obvious he pumped up for this role and he looks pretty darn good in them -- or less. Theres an extended sequence in a cave where he has to strip down to his undies. Theres a nice bit where he has to chase after Miss Eleniak in the buff, with only his hands cupped over his groin. William McNamara is naturally a little on the skinny side, but he has a nice, generous handful of a booty. Also, theres a moment when hes getting out of bed that if you pause the action at just the right moment you can see the whole enchilada. If youre inclined to do so, and come on, half of the people who choose to watch a movie about Navy men on a road trip are. Id just like thank Dennis Hopper for his equal opportunity gratuitous nudity. Can William McNamara act? Heck if I know.|0.643483886932|0.156798321074|0.356516113068

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116953/|Mad Dog Time (1996)|This is is a thoroughly unpleasant, if slickly made, movie. I tried it because it stars Richard Dreyfus and Jeff Goldblum, two good actors, and because the plot line - a mob boss is about to be released from a mental institution - sounded promising. The movie is billed as a comedy, sorta. What we have is an endless series of shots - you should pardon the pun - of people in dimly lit and elegant, if somewhat surreal, interiors, shooting each other - in the head, stomach, kneecap, foot, heart (no part of the anatomy is avoided, it seems) while uttering vague and cryptic dialogue, some of which is supposed, evidently, to be humorous in a sort of post-modern way. Goldblums dialogue for the whole movie could fit on a 3x5 card, and he wears a single facial expression - a sardonic grin - throughout. Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines do the best they can. Burt Reynolds does a cameo. The credits list Rob Reiner and Joey Bishop, but I somehow missed them (good move on their part). The whole thing is cold, sterile, mechanical and unsavory; an heir, I suspect, to the style of Pulp Fiction, Fargo and Natural Born Killers.

The first ten minutes were nothing but guys trying to tell Goldblum what was in store for him when Dreyfuss gets out, but Ill save you all the trouble: skip this movie.<br /><br />The actual reason I picked this movie is because Ive been on a Diane Lane kick lately and have been trying to see all her movies. The real let-down for me wasnt just the terrible plot, but also the fact that she doesnt show up until the last fifteen minutes of the movie (although we hear about her all through the movie). Even being a fan of over half of the cast cant help me enjoy this film.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114658/|Theodore Rex (1995)|These reviews that claim this movie is so bad its good are going way overboard with that one. This movie does not have the guilty pleasure badness that Leonard Part 6, Battlefield Earth and Gigli had. Those movies were entertaining in their awfulness but this pile of dinosaur dung is so bad its painful. I havent been in this much pain watching a bad movie since I watched Baby Geniuses and Superbabies. Before I start the review let me tell you the story. Theodore Rex is a $35 million dollar bust The New Line Cinema refused to put in theaters. They cut the losses sending it straight to video making it the most expensive straight-to-video movie in decades. Whoopi caved in to be in this disaster after a huge paycheck.<br /><br />Plot: a millionaire clones dinosaurs so he can launch missiles at the sun which would kill mankind and start another Ice Age. A female cop named Katie Coltrane and an idiotic dinosaur named Theodore Rex reluctantly team up to stop him after the death of a buddy dinosaur.<br /><br />The plot is given to you in the beginning of the movie which robs the movie of all its mystery. Then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually quite awful. Whoopi looks agitated and is trying to wing it with her performance but to no avail. Theodore Rex is flat out annoying and his bumbling behavior wears thin after five minutes on screen. Most of the jokes revolve around him threatening to bite people and hitting people with his tail(on accident and on purpose). I thought Burglar was bad but it takes a backseat to Theodore Rex: the worst movie of Whoopis career.<br /><br />Dont let anybody tell you this monstrosity is bad enough to be enjoyable. I didnt see that when I watched this movie. All I saw was a train wreck that was written by people that must have had some sick admiration for movie Howard The Duck. The humor is on that level and Theodore Rex looks like the inbred cousin of Barney. Utterly painful from start to finish.|0.905353137717|0.112099855712|0.0946468622833

Never. And its not even entertainingly bad in an Ed Wood kinda way - it just SUCKS. Now this film was famous in Hollywood at the time it was made because Whoopi took off the gloves and made it clear to the press and anyone else who would listen that she HATED THIS PIECE OF CRAP = she tried to get out of her contract, she whined, she moaned but nonetheless they pour her fat butt into this leather skin tight futuristic cop uniform that is ghastly to see, yikes!!!!

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/|Titanic (1997)|There is a lot of obvious hype associated with this film. Lets just face it, though, the main reasons why anyone would watch it would be for Leo and Cate, who are not necessarily the best actors in this film. Im not saying theyre not good actors, Im saying they stunk in this film. The special effects were decent (and I will say the film makers did a good job making the ship eye-pleasing), but IT even has several major flaws. For instance, right before the ship goes under, you can see an unfinished blue-screen image behind your main characters.<br /><br />Dont get me wrong, I LOVE the story of the REAL Titanic, but I find this movie an insult to that story. Editing was atrocious--theres no reason for any film to be over 2 1/2 hours (with the exception of MAYBE a biographical movie), and the writing and screenplay was horribly stilted.<br /><br />I will say that the music was perhaps better than I could have predicted (and not just the My Heart Will Go On song either). There is one scene that stands out to me when the ship is sinking and pounding bass music is heard. That could very well be the highlight of the film. As for the mood throughout, it was extremely dull. I was more relieved than sad when Jack died, which I know cannot be what the director intended.<br /><br />In a nut shell, I find it horrible that they turned the beautiful story of the Titanic into an over-hyped chick flick.|0.676019723207|0.150138027222|0.323980276793
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/|Titanic (1997)|I, like many people, saw this film in the theatre when it first came out in 97. It was a below average film at best, defiantly not the masterpiece that all these Titanic fanboys like to make it out as. First off, DiCaprio is a terrible actor no matter which way you look at it. People just like him because of his looks. His acting skills essentially consist of saying a lot of cheesy lines and trying to act sexy. Second, the film itself had a rather boring and simple plot: girl falls in love with guy, ship theyre on sinks, lots of crappy love scenes thereafter. Anyone with an IQ above 50 will realize this isnt ingenious in any way whatsoever. Nor is it original. Plus the director felt the need to drag it out for 3+ hours. I could compress it into a 1 hour block without losing any of the plot. In conclusion, Titanic is the most overrated movie to date.

It made a lot of money because teenage girls went to see the movie 7 times in the theaters because of Leonardo. Where the hell did they get the money? Anyway, I wanted to learn more about the Titanic; why it sank, what was running through a lot of peoples minds; maybe even a little conspiracy stuff. Does anyone realize that certain people didnt even board the ship because there was a fire on board before it even took off? No, you dont because all you see is a rich girl falling for a poor boy and he paints her naked (did that corny junk at least tip you off that the movie was stupid?).<br /><br />I did cry in during one scene, though. The scene when they showed the water that was filling up in the ship. It looked like pool water! Im thinking this movie made all this money and they couldnt even make the water from the ocean look real? unbelievable...<br /><br />Ohhh the band played on while the ship sank.. Just ridiculous.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/|Titanic (1997)|First of all, as a long time student of the Titanic disaster and member of several Titanic clubs, I feel entitled to comment on the film. I dont really care how many awards and accolades the film won, but to me it is still an absolutely awful film. Cameron had the resources to make a proper semi-documentary film of the disaster but unfortunately chose to turn it into a po-faced romantic mush. The fact that so many people around the world fell for it only shows, to my mind, the sad state of taste and common sense that movie critics and audiences have these days. Whoever said that all movies should have a hero and heroine falling in love? In fact most real events are anything but romantic and the Titanic disaster certainly was not one. I feel that it needed a better script and director with a semi-documentary approach and as little artistic license as possible. I almost threw up in the last sequence where the dead lovers meet among the other lost passengers and crew who break out in applause. Is this an intelligent film?

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/|Titanic (1997)|Ive just had the evidence that confirmed my suspicions. A bunch of kids, 14 to 22 put on the DVD of Titanic on a fantastic state of the art mega screen home entertainment type deal. Only two of them had actually seen it before. But they all had seen the moment of Kate, Leo and Celine Dion so many times that most of them felt they had seen the whole movie. Shortly after the epic started, they started to get restless, some of them left asking the others -- call us when the iceberg appears Over an hour and a half into the movie, only the two girls who had seen the movie before, were still there. They started shouting: iceberg, iceberg. A stampede followed, they all came back to see the sinking of the Titanic. They sat open mouthed, emitting Ohs and far outs. So, just like I thought when the movie first burst into the scene. What is this? One and a half hours waiting for the bloody thing to sink but what about the rest of the of it. Dr. Zivagho, for instance, had a similar running time, but think how much takes place in that film within the same period of time. In Titanic Leo teaches Kate how to spit. Look at the faces and hands of the, supposedly, creme de la creme in the first class dining room of the ship. Look at the historical details, if you can find them. The storyline is so thin that they have to introduce guns and shootings in a ship that is about to sink. The real sinking here is of film standards. All the efforts are focus on special effects and opening week ends. The film went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time so, what do I know?|0.499965730639|0.174496977611|0.500034269361

How is it that so many enjoyed what I consider to be a woefully bad adaptation of my second favourite Jane Austen novel? There are many problems with the film, already mentioned in a few reviews; simply put it is a hammed-up, over-acted, chintzy mess from opening credits to butchered ending.<br /><br />While many characters are mis-cast and neither Ewan McGregor nor Toni Collette puts in a performance that is worthy of them, the worst by far is Paltrow. I have very much enjoyed her performance in some roles, but here she is abominable - she is self-conscious, nasal, slouching and entirely disconnected from her characters and those around her. An extremely disappointing effort - though even a perfect Emma could not have saved this film.|0.572736901474|0.190101821278|0.427263098526
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116191/|Emma (1996)|Bah. Another tired, desultory reworking of an out of copyright work never designed to be filmed.<br /><br />On the plus side, Toni Collette is superb as always (being an actual actress, you see), and there are some nicely handled handover cuts between scenes. There are even a few genuinely funny lines, and the filmwork, score and editing is competent, apart from a bizarre lapse into voiceover and speaking to the camera towards the conclusion.<br /><br />But, ah, but. Much of the cast seems to be on autopilot, and they are almost all very clearly too old (and in one case too young) for their declared ages. Worse, they are all speaking Austinese, that peculiar falsetto self satisfied sing song that couldnt be further from the way people actually spoke in Austens day (think Yosemite Sam, I kid you not). This is particularly sad, considering that we seem to finally be seeing the demise of the equally farcial Fakespearan that Olivier and his cronies were so fond of bellowing at the top of their lungs.<br /><br />And worst of all is Gwyneth Paltrow. Shes only ever played one character in her films, and she stays true to form here, running through her entire range (smirking to sulking) in the first ten minutes, then just repeating herself for the rest of the overlong film. There is absolutely no chemistry between herself and any of her admirers, nor any apparent reason why they would be interested in her apart.<br /><br />In short, there is very little reason to watch Emma. Its an amiable enough adaptation, but if youre going to pack a film full of anacronisms (i.e. an appalingly thin lead who cant shoot a bow or handle a period accent) then you might as well do it properly, as with the vastly superior Clueless.|0.718901452854|0.143611111111|0.281098547146

Ive always considered them irritating, stupid and boring. However, after watching this terrible rendition, I was forced to admit that the original Emma was delightful and charming. Ewan McGregor scarcely serves a purpose in this film after they hacked and mutilated the part of Frank Churchill. Gweneth Paltrow is ridiculous in an already ridiculous character and the rest of the film is unremarkable and stupid.<br /><br />My recommendation to anybody who is remotely interested in English period drama... go see the originals.

The scriptwriters have decided to stick in bits of ridiculous humour which are embarrassing at the best of times, but also ruin the feel of the period.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116191/|Emma (1996)|I honestly had somewhat high expectations when I first began to watch this movie, but it turned out to be probably one of the most boring films I have ever seen!<br /><br />First of all, the pace is incredibly slow, so it seems much longer than it is (and its not short).Im sure when Jane Austen wrote the book, she made it several pages long, filled it with description, and didnt intend for people to read in in one day, or it might drag and lose its appeal, which Emma most certainly did. Now Sense and Sensibility had this flaw of a slow pace, but at least it had lively lines to make up for it, as well as some good performances!<br /><br />That brings me to flaw #2, which is of course, the acting. While I dont happen to care for basically anybody involved in this film, I am sure they are capable of good work, but I didnt see much of it in this movie. It was like people were trying too hard to be witty, too hard to be upper-class, too hard to be British (well, some of them), so they all just came off as a bunch of actors and not as people.<br /><br />#3. The cast, as I said, seemed only like actors, and not actually like the people they were playing. Maybe thats a good thing, because the people they played really werent all that nice. Why did everybody like Emma, for example? Sure, she was nice to the rich, handsome people in front of them, but she was an awful gossip behind their backs. If her friends were ugly, then she didnt even bother to go behind their backs. So, why is this girl so great? Why do people have to tell stories, just to make her laugh? Of course the snob couldnt even do that right. I have enough problems with Gwyneth Paltrow as Gwyneth Paltrow, and her Emma did not exactly change my opinion.<br /><br />Well, its easy to see that I did not care for this one.

Also, the Treasury cops dont seem to coordinate anything with the local rescue people.

The usually reliable John Lithgow, perhaps depressed by the sheer awfulness of the product, is reduced to sneering and calling those for whom he doesnt care Bostid! in a vague approximation of an English accent.

Somehow, countless close-ups of Russos face slipped passed in the post-production stages, and she literally fills the screen so many times the poor apes are upstaged. Unintentionally funny true story adapted from Gertrude Trudy Davies Lints memoirs about a wealthy doctors wife who turns their mansion into a menagerie for pets and wild-life. The movie goes beyond good intentions...it positively drips with earnest sincerity. The movie never sparkles with the kind of family film magic that it needed, and before too long both the people and the animals seem distinctly programmed (nothing here feels real). About ten minutes in, two chimpanzees are goofing around in Russos kitchen and start throwing a butchers knife back and forth (it misses Alan Cummings head by inches); yet, no eyebrows are raised because its all in a days fun. Still, when full-grown gorilla Buddy gets crazy during a thunderstorm, the cops are called--and everyone stares at Buddy through the window while he busts up the living room furniture. The furniture should be the least of anyones worries in this flabbergasting, do-gooder failure. But, at least we know Russo was in good hands: whenever director Caroline Thompson needs a good pick-up shot, she gives unstartled Rene another extreme close-up.

The film claims to be based on a true story but in effect, it does not even come close to what actually happened to Buddy - who in real life, was the famous Gargantua, sold to Ringling Bros. by our supposed heroic Gertrude Lintz, known by many animal enthusiasts as a woman who hardly had her animals welfare in the best interest. As far as Buddy being portrayed as becoming aggressive, this was total fiction and at no time did the gorilla, in real life, resort to such behavior. buddy did, in fact, escape his wooden crate (not a plush cage room as depicted in movie) during a storm, to seek shelter and comfort in the house, which frightened Gertrude Lintz into selling him. No, Buddy was not released into a gorilla family surrounded by lush trees in a zoological paradise - he was abandoned in a wooden crate, deep in the back of a garage for some time with only a single light bulb for comfort and then sold to the circus - where he actually lived a better life having peanuts thrown at him until he died (historically the oldest living gorilla on record, by the way) before a show in Miami.

Angels in the Outfield is another movie in which everything seems lost until someone or something magically comes and saves the day. Do I even need to tell you how it ends? The movie is just plain lowly escapism (examples of high escapism are the various sci-fi movies from the 50s). If these movies had some political undertone - or at least offered us a new look at life - then they would be OK; this one is just pointless. Far closer to diabolical than angelic. Also starring Tony Danza, Adrien Brody and Matthew McConaughey, and I suspect that they dont wish to stress this in their resumes.|0.771820108982|0.180359384453|0.228179891018
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025586/|Of Human Bondage (1934)|Although Bette Davis did a WONDERFUL job as Mildred, I felt that the film wasnt the best I had seen. At the end of the movie I was left feeling like there was something missing in it.<br /><br />Bette Davis did a perfect job, though, and she made me hate her and pity her all the while. Leslie Howard did very good as the lovelorn Philip Carey, and I so pitied him throughout the movie for being in love with such a horrible dame. Its such a sad thing when one finds him/herself in love with a bad seed. And especially if its someone like Philp Carey, who is a sensitive person, though pathetic.<br /><br />In the end, the acting was what came through and not the plot. The ending scene was particularly good, but I am not one to give it away. Although others may find this movie good, I was one who found it so-so. I should recommend this movie to those who like a bad seed so they can see what may happen to them if they find themselves in love with that horrible person.|0.52222185868|0.117223056518|0.47777814132
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025586/|Of Human Bondage (1934)|W. Somerset Maughams Of Human Bondage is supposed to be a English language classic. If so, much must have been missing from the film version here. Phillips (Leslie Howard) attraction to Mildred (Bette Davis) is so utterly inexplicable as to make the scenario seem like the post-breakup retelling of a relationship from the mans point of view. Being a family lawyer Ive heard many such accounts; the man depicts himself as noble and always correct, and the woman is a hellion who has had no other objective than to exploit the man.<br /><br />Indeed, unless one is willing to laugh at the social assumptions of the film maker, this is an uncomfortable movie to watch. Phillip even indulges Mildred when she brings over a baby of indeterminate paternity, but the real high point comes when Phillip allows Mildred - enraged and now of dubious sanity - the free run of his flat, with predictable results. Bette Davis was attractive for about five years of her life, but that period didnt occur here. In fact, by the end of the movie she looks a lot like the Baby Jane character she would play thirty years later.<br /><br />I note how Howards character is always impeccably dressed and groomed. It tells me that Phillip craves middle class respectability. Someone like that could not run from a woman with a course Cockney accent fast enough. Phillip is, for most of the movie, a student; such a person would have been more believable if he had been younger, and had the disheveled looks that bespeak the low income and the low self esteem that often accompanies student status - an English Raskolnikov, as it will. And balanced that by allowing Mildred a modicum of charm.|0.808683330117|0.235860777253|0.191316669883

However, I was sadly disappointed in the script and the entire plot of the story. David Duchovny,(Dr. Eugene Sands),Connie & Carla,04, was the doctor in the story who uses drugs and losses his license to practice medicine. Dr. Sands was visiting a night club and was able to use his medical experience to help a wounded customer and was assisted by Angelina Jolie,(Claire),Taking Lives,04, who immediately becomes attracted to Dr. David Sands. Timothy Hutton,(Raymond Blossom),Kinsey,04, plays the Big Shot Gangster and a man with all kinds of money and connections. Timothy Hutton seems to over act in most of the scenes and goes completely out of his mind trying to keep his gang members from being killed. Gary Dourdan,(Yates),CSI-Vegas TV Series, plays a great supporting role and portrays a real COOL DUDE who is a so-called body guard for Raymond Blossom. Angelina Jolie looks beautiful and sexy with her ruby red lips which draws a great deal of attention from all the men.

This is really the only reason I could leave the television on - morbid fascination. It wasnt so much the acting, which was only mediocre or slightly worse than one would expect from this cast, but the premise and the plot which never should have seen the light of day. The script, too, is groan-inducing. As for cinematography, did anyone else notice that they used a curtains drawing segue device, like in an old 50s TV show...but without irony? At first I thought they must be kidding but the movie takes itself too seriously to have used this in a tongue-in-cheek manner. Dont even ask me about the score...the only high point is the final song, by Morcheeba. I guess they wanted to leave people with something for their $8...glad I saw it on TV!!!!! Just silly! I wonder if this is why Timothy Hutton has had trouble finding much work recently?

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119906/|Playing God (1997)|Its hard to believe that in 1997 David Duchovny was at the top of his fame, with X-Files, one of the best sci-fi series ever, being at the top of the glory. Nine years later he is almost forgotten, and his tentatives to make it on the big screen failed miserably. I cannot even explain why, he is a fair actor, but probably his moment of fame cast him in a eternal role that takes big talent to break from.<br /><br />At the same time Angelina Jolie was much less known, and she was really lucky that a film like Playing God did not led her career into a dead-end. Fortunately for her, The Bone Collector and Girl, Interrupted were waiting beyond the corner, and when Lara Croft came, her career was launched.<br /><br />There is not too much to be told about this film. Its the only big screen film of Andy Wilson, and there must be a reason. All is banal and most of what happens on the screen expected in this story of an ex-doctor who saves the life of a shooting victim in a bar only to find himself working for the mob. The off-screen voice is especially bad, with a moralistic text that kills any shade of cinematographic experience from the film. You probably will not meet the film but in DVD rental stores, or on TV. Try to look for something better.|0.856552072974|0.847672141999|0.143447927026

For starters, the script was definitely written to be made into a B-film, but somehow Duchovny (looking for a star vehicle to elevate himself out of television) and Hutton (looking for the two of a one-two punch he had hoped would define his career after Ordinary People) became attached to the picture. Cheesy lines, big bad wipes from scene to scene (Come on--who uses wipes after 12th Grade Telecommunications class?), and plain old bad acting sink this film. Even Duchovny is not immune to the bad acting plague that is this film. Only Timothy Hutton rises above the material at all. I must admit feeling Duchovnys pain as he read the lines that are the voice-over. While I found myself laughing when Im sure the director wanted me to feel terrified, nothing prepared me for the closing line of Duchonveys voice-over: if you ever need a doctor, be sure to call 911. If only the studio had called 911, this dog of a motion picture would never have been made. Avoid at all costs. <br /><br />|0.887245964848|0.148921964524|0.112754035152

Bill Murray turned from being a quick witted, humorous guy into an arsehole who was shouting things at people in the street that just werent funny, its like he was trying too hard to be funny. His character stole a weapon (an RV? come on...) and ends up being a national hero after invading another country and killing god knows how many soldiers, for a laugh. One good point is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the US Army and shows how arrogant and imbecilic they really are, albeit unintentionally.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083131/|Stripes (1981)|I didnt like this Bill Murray vehicle when it was originally released in the 80s, so I tried watching it again to see if my distaste for this film was down to my movie-going tastes in the 80s or was it that Stripes is simply a bad movie. Well, the verdict is in and Stripes is a bad movie.<br /><br />Now, Stripes may have been innovative comedy in the early 80s, and it may appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are Bill Murray fans, but its still a bad movie.<br /><br />Why is it bad? Mostly because Stripes is supposed to be a comedy but its just not that funny. There are some laughs, but they are few and far between. Most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly convoluted and not very interesting. This lack of comedy is especially noticeable if youre used to more contemporary comedies such as Anchorman which strive for laughs in every part of the movie.<br /><br />Stripes further suffers from Bill Murray and Harold Ramiss lack of acting ability. Bill Murray is a great comedian but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career, and Harold Ramis is playing Harold Ramis. These two are just not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arch of the movie.<br /><br />Lastly, most of the comedy that there is in Stripes revolves around Bill Murrays self-centered, smart-alec man-child character so if you dont find that character funny (like I didnt) youre not going to find most of what little comedy there is in Stripes funny either.<br /><br />Stripes is very much a movie of its era, it hasnt aged well and is not worth watching. If you want to watch an early 80s buddy comedy I would recommend Stir Crazy. Like Stripes the humor in Stir Crazy is not as fast-paced as in contemporary comedies, but unlike Stripes it has aged much better and as a result is still watchable.|0.866213792671|0.150048500882|0.133786207329
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027125/|Top Hat (1935)|The wife of a stage producer in London hopes to fix up the American song-and-dance man starring in her husbands latest show with an acquaintance, an American girl who makes her living modeling fashions in society circles. Unfortunately, the couple has already met on their own, with the girl thinking the guy is actually the show producer married to her friend (the fact hes not wearing a wedding ring should have discouraged any misunderstandings!). Wafty Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musical is eventually dragged back down to the earth by Dwight Taylor and Allan Scotts idiotic script, which is full of juvenile behavior. Astaire and Rogers dont just meet cute--they meet ridiculously (hes tap-dancing like a madman in the hotel suite above hers and she complains). Audiences of 1935 probably didnt care how these two were going to get together--as long as they did so, and happily. Seen today, the central characters appear to have no motivation to end up in each others arms: he plies her with flowers (after telling his friend he wants to remain fancy free in the love department) and she gives him the brush-off. Nothing that a little dancing couldnt cure! This glamorous twosome are as deliberately unreal as are the London and Venice settings, but we watch simply because the leads are Fred and Ginger. Its a fantasy for have-nots...ones who dont mind the dumbed-down plot. The musical moments do break up the monotony of the contrived scenario, yet fail to transcend the surrounding silliness. ** from ****|0.699200013333|0.875041532216|0.300799986667

With big-name actors like Maggie Smith, Albert Finney, and many others, there was no reason for the movie to fail. However, the movie lacked an ending, had a sorry excuse for a plot line, and fell to pieces with its continuity. A typical story of a rich girl and a poor boy, brought together by love and destroyed by beauty (or lack thereof) and disapproval, has a touching side of a mothers early death and an absentee father. The father, played by Finney, is a disturbed man, tormenting his daughter in life as well as death. He believes his daughters lack of good looks would ruin his fortune by marrying beneath their social status. The actors vainly attempted to salvage what was left of the storyline. Washington Square is a black hole of ruin and destruction, wasting precious time of those who sorrowfully watch. I give this movie a 1 instead of a 0, purely for the actors attempts.

It has none of the understated and simple beauty that a movie with no plot can have, such as Onegin. I agree with other comments about Leighs portrayal of Catherine as an idiot, instead of naive and shy; she made me despise her not feel for her.<br /><br />Catherines transition from childlike trusting to adult cynicism, the whole point of the story, was internalised, just as it was in the novel.

I was very excited to see a new movie coming out, based on the book of that title. Jennifer Jason Lee is an exceptional actress and Ben Chaplin good enough to play the lead roles. Albert Finney is miscast and doesnt carry the role well. I wanted to shoot Maggie Smith....or rather her silly, insipid role. The real problem and whats lacking in this latest version is a good script, music, and direction.<br /><br />I fell asleep in the theater watching this long, drawn out and exceptionally boring movie. There are more pauses in the dialog than a Pinter Play. In the book I felt a deep caring for Catherine Sloper and her life. The movie had just the opposite effect.

Chaplin appears bemused by what cannot possibly be understood as Leighs shyness and lack of grace, but rather her orthopedic unsteadiness. There has to be some element of believability to his interest, but as played it is incomprehensible. The performances do not jibe.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120481/|Washington Square (1997)|Washington Square is a flat, shabby adaptation of the short novel by Henry James. Indeed, the novel is very good, but far from the level of James masterpieces. Moreover its simple, eventless story seems unsuited to make it into a film (although William Wyler, with his The Heiress, gave in 1949 a beautiful version of the novel). <br /><br />Anyway, the movie completely betrays the spirit of this work of the great American writer. In the novel, the heroine Catherine is shy, not very attractive and somewhat clumsy, but nonetheless she is a sound, intelligent young woman, and shes not as naive as it may seem. Her attachment for her father is dignified and respectful, with no morbid sides in it. Along three quarters of the movie, Catherine (Jennifer Jason Leigh) just seems to be mentally retarded, poor thing. In the last quarter, she suddenly (and incredibly) becomes intelligent, aware of her dignity as a woman, and all that.<br /><br />The director Agnieszka Holland has added two vulgar scenes to the story. The first, when the nervous child Catherine has, well, troubles with her vesica. The second scene, when we see on the background a sort of open-air brothel, with prostitutes taking their customers behind tents, and so on. Nothing could be more contrary to the spirit and artistic ideals of Henry James. It is notorious that the writer was extremely decent and demure even for the standards of the Victorian age. I defy anyone to find any coarseness anywhere in the thousands of pages of James huge literary production. I really was particularly annoyed by these two scenes.<br /><br />Yes, I know that a director needs reasonable freedom in the screen adaptation of a novel. But if a director utterly ignores or misunderstands the art of an author (here Henry James), I dont see the point of using his work to make a bad movie. <br /><br />The acting is adequate to the movie: poor and flat, in spite of the talent of Albert Finney and Maggie Smith.

Maybe the ending of the cold war had everything to do with it but I found this set up very unconvincing . It`s not helped by some errors in geography like the French carrier Foch being in the Med ( Wouldn`t the Foch be better positioned in the black sea ? ) or that the expositional newsreel consists of familar footage featuring conflicts from the Balkans , the first gulf war and even Vietnam . Once again the adjective  Very unconvincing  crept into my mind . The story does improve somewhat when the story proper - A battle of wills concerning orders between a nuclear submarine commander and his number two - gets underway . Director Tony Scott does his best as do the cast , but the problem still lies in an unconvincing scenario . The worst thing is that if this had been made in the mid 1980s when WW3 was a real possibility - Nay probability - this film would have terrified me , but after the cold war ended so had the dangers of nuclear war which means CRIMSON TIDE has little impact .|0.740894102075|0.16358055213|0.259105897925

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112740/|Crimson Tide (1995)|As a former submariner, this was one of the worst submarine movies I have ever seen. First of all, a mutiny aboard any US Naval vessel, particularly a Nuclear Powered Trident submarine in unthinkable. These men are the best of the best and are dedicated to their mission. The responsibility they carry is awesome and they take it very seriously all the way from the Captain to the most junior crew member. I could never see a crew of any ship split their alliance between the Captain and the Executive Officer. An Executive Officer who acted as the Character played by Denzel Washington did would be relieved of his duties and Court Martialed, then drummed from the Navy. It is no surprise the Navy refused to send a technical adviser to help in making this film. Lastly, if any member of a submarine crew made the amount of noise made underway on this vessel they would be severely reprimanded. Submariners learn early in their career to be as quiet as possible to avoid detection. They dont slam doors and even speak quietly and wear soft soled shoes when underway. I was amazed at how loud they portrayed the crew while underway. Loud music would never be tolerated. I know portraying submarine life in reality would not sell movie tickets, but this is over the top to the point of being ridiculous.

However, the ending is so terrible and Hollywoodized that it completely undermines the first 80% of the movie.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a submarine and the possibility that they received an order to fire their nuclear missiles. The Captain, Gene Hackman, is all for launching, while his first officer, Denzel Washington, is in favor of confirming the launch orders first. The problem is, to launch BOTH the captain and 1st officer must simultaneously use their launch keys. Hackman is determined to launch and Washington stands firm until eventually this results in armed insurrection aboard the sub. Eventually, the mistake is discovered and the missiles are not launched. Cool. However, here comes the part that just doesnt ring true. After they are back on land and go before a review board, Washington and Hackman (whod just spent half the movie trying to kill each other) shake hands and are all buddy buddy! Huh?!

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091763/|Platoon (1986)|Im both amused and disgusted by the people who claim that this movie is so accurate about Vietnam, and WERE NEVER THERE. This movie is about as true about the whole Vietnam war as the Rodney King beating is true about ALL police officers. Yes, bad things do (and did) happen, but in general the people there are just like you and me. They have morals, they are not killing machines, they do not all do drugs. Atrocities were the exception in Vietnam, not the rule. They happened far more infrequently than the hype would lead you believe. Oliver Stone has a knack for making movies that show the Vietnam war as this brutal bloodbath, but are based as much in reality as Star Wars. If you honestly believe the stereotypes of Vietnam, do yourself a favour and learn the truth. Fact: the Viet Cong and NVA did far worse things to the South Vietnamese than ANY soldier in the US Armed Forces ever did. Fact: the soldiers in World War II treated the enemy far worse in general than the soldiers in Vietnam did, and they were WELCOMED when they came home. The fine Americans who served this country in Vietnam deserve our respect; though the war was badly fought from a political standpoint, no one could have asked for more from our soldiers, and it is a great disservice to assert that this kind of mostly true fiction is the way things really were there.|0.494286773635|0.158129484897|0.505713226365
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091763/|Platoon (1986)|Platoon is to the Vietnam War as Rocky IV is to heavyweight championship boxing. Oliver Stones story of the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is so overdone its laughable. While most or all of the occurrences in Platoon did occur over the 10+ year span of US military involvement in Vietnam, to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame (weeks) gives a horribly skewed picture of the war. In Platoon, the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two: US soldiers murdering civilians, US Soldiers raping civilians, a US Sergeant murdering another US Sergeant, a US Private murdering a US Staff Sergeant, US soldiers killed/wounded by friendly fire, 90%+ killed or wounded in the platoon. For Stone to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a US soldier in Vietnam is a disgrace. Two Vietnam War films I would recommend are We Were Soldiers (the TRUE story of arguably the worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam) and HBOs A Bright Shining Lie.|0.554681220568|0.573719926567|0.445318779432

The book Panzram: A Journal of Murder by Thomas E. Gaddis and James O. Long, which came out the better part of a century after Panzrams death, gives the historical context to a first-generation Americans account of running away from home to go west and be a cowboy, getting caught, thrown in the boys home, getting away repeatedly and thrown into prison over and over all the time getting tortured and sodomized. As Panzram grew huge and strong, he sought to take revenge for the wrong done to him as he traveled to South America, Europe and Africa, and it didnt matter what people he raped, robbed, or murdered because we are all equally worthless.<br /><br />This film casts skinny James Woods as the rough neck, mean-ass, son of a bitch Carl Panzram who in the film is a drunk, overly-dramatic and emotional, and who never mentions the joy of sodomizing men and boys. The film neither elaborates on anything else particularly of note about this world traveler and career prisoner (like robbing former President Taft or being released from the Oregon prison as long as he gave his word to return).

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110632/|Natural Born Killers (1994)|*Spoilers* Some people claim that Natural Born Killers is brilliant criticism of the media obsession with violence. But this contention ignores the actual content of the film. Oliver Stone could have shown his serial killers as vicious, inhuman murderers of innocent people and contrasted this with a morbid media fascination. Instead he lends them justification. The movie portrays just about every victim as someone who deserved to be hurt. Engaging in vicious stereotyping, Stone presents the victims as unpleasant caricatures - dumb rednecks, broken-English speaking immigrants, lazy fat people. The one person that the homicidal lovebirds is also a stereotype. Of course they befriend the old, hallucinogen-using American-Indian - because theyre trendy, dude? Lets make him an admirable character. Fat, Chinese clerks and hicks are uncool, so lets make it seem like the deserve to die. Instead of twisted,hateful that are corrupted by their misdeeds, their rampage makes them happier and more in love. Mickey and Mallory are made sexy and cool and surreal visuals are bound to entice more impressionable people. Justice is mocked. The police and prison officials are portrayed as brutal, ugly and scowling compared to the GQ murderers. Again, this is not in the media reports within the film but in the reality in the film. There is no nuance or subtlety in the film - just overblown performances and visuals. The film says nothing new or specific about the obsession with violence. The proof that the film fails in its message lies in actual real world reactions to it. Some impressionable young people who saw this movie cited it as inspiration for murders that they committed. The films message is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with horrendous real-life results. The clever message is nowhere to be seen.|0.398331240079|0.139788894575|0.601668759921

I still think the directing and cinematography are excellent, as is the music. But its really the script that has over the time started to bother me more and more. I find Emma Thompsons writing self-absorbed and unfaithful to the original book; she has reduced Marianne to a side-character, a second fiddle to her much too old, much too severe Elinor - she in the movie is given many sort of focus moments, and often they appear to be there just to show off Thompson herself.<br /><br />I do understand her cutting off several characters from the book, but leaving out the one scene where Willoughby in the book is redeemed? For someone who red and cherished the book long before the movie, those are the things always difficult to digest.<br /><br />As for the actors, I love Kate Winslet as Marianne. She is not given the best script in the world to work with but she still pulls it up gracefully, without too much sentimentality. Alan Rickman is great, a bit old perhaps, but he plays the role beautifully. And Elizabeth Spriggs, she is absolutely fantastic as always.|0.357465746142|0.0923661652336|0.642534253858

Instead of delivering a pointed commentary about the role of urban women struggling to stay afloat in a world where men cruelly abuse and humiliate them, Gray, Bufford and Lanier prefers to pummel their unsuspecting audience with highbrow notions of operatic tragedy. Its melodrama at its worst. Gray has his actors linger over every tired line and John Carters lazy editing refuses to pick up the slack, choosing instead to keep his camera trained on the performers bemused faces. And bemused they are: although actors such as Jada Pinkett, Kimberly Elise and Vivica A. Fox have some raw talent (Queen Latifah is the fourth and as an actress shes an excellent rapper), they need a surer hand than Grays to guide them and as a result they come off as shrill and uncomfortable in front of the camera.

Danny Glover was cast as the bad guy, but - again - most viewers imagination could not go far enough as to believe him in that role. Also, Jared Leto was not believable as the former medicine student. The tension was just not there, since the killer was known very early.

Moreover, Jared Letos character does not really contribute to the story whatsoever (except saving one main characters life at one point, but that scene is as necessary as a windshield wiper on a submarine in the first place ;-)<br /><br />Speaking of unnecessary scenes - the main complaint is really the tangled and cliché-ridden storyline: The detective (of course!) has to settle a personal matter with the villain and is (of course!) suspended from his official duties courtesy of his personal entanglement. The killer (of course!) *wants* to be tracked down and plays a cat-and-mouse game with his opponent for years ... I dont know how many movies build on a similar plot - most of them better, however.<br /><br />The plot has got holes galore and many completely unbelievable and unnecessary scenes that do not contribute to or work well with the storyline at all (e.g. the truck stop scene or the car at the cliffs edge etc.)<br /><br />To top it off, the ending tries to be original and exciting, but fails completely in these regards.

As an unabashed Brad Pitt fan (I consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation), I expected to *love* this flick - and yet, it left me cold.<br /><br />It could be a failing within myself, but I tend to point toward the creative end of this movie - direction, scriptwriting, production, editing - somehow, they lost me.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120102/|Seven Years in Tibet (1997)|i read the book 7 years in Tibet from Heinrich Harrer and was fascinated of it. then i immediately grabbed the DVD and started to watch the movie. i remember the first time i saw it back in 98, i kinda liked it. well, now i watched it again in full knowledge of the book it is based on. and soon i realized how WRONG it all was told:<br /><br />when they enter Lhasa the people start to stick their tongues out of their mouths and Thewlis and Pitt have the impression that its the way to say hello in Tibet, so they greet back... in the book Harrer explains, that sticking the tongue out is a sign of absolute humbleness and loyalty in Tibet and they may do it in front of the Dalai Lama but certainly not for these two europeans! not only the mother but even the Dalai Lama himself was wearing glasses in the public. in the book Harrer mentions, that no one in Tibet wore glasses to that time(sorry forgot the reason, but its explained in the book too).the young Dalai Lama did, but only when he was alone and nobody could see him! and what about that Mao tse tung lookalike, destroying the mandala in front of the young living buddha?? childish... and the tailor made Harrer and Aufschnaiter tibetan clothes not European designer suits! why are so many events that really happened eliminated from the story, just to fill the time with a fictional love interest (the female tailor...)that is completely unimportant? just like the whole story about harrers son, rolf. not one word is mentioned about him or even any family member of harrer in the book. but that was OK for me because 7 years in Tibet is not a book about harrers person. its about tibet. Im very disappointed by this adaption of the famous book. and i bet heinrich harrer was, too... 3 stars, just for the cinematography.|0.834710278974|0.486752164042|0.165289721026
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120102/|Seven Years in Tibet (1997)|Ive read all the comments on this film. I am a great admirer<br /><br />of the Dalai Lama. As such, I read the book upon which this<br /><br />film was based. The movie is an ugly and demeaning fictionalization of the truth. I do not criticize it for<br /><br />altering small details or events for dramatic purposes; it is<br /><br />not a documentary. But the script CHANGES the impact, reaction,<br /><br />realities, and changes in EVERY main character. It vastly alters<br /><br />the real relationship between Harrar and the young Dalai Lama. <br /><br />From the ridiculous rivalry for a Tibetan woman (which demeans<br /><br />the culture of Tibet) to Harras music box gift, to Harrars<br /><br />change of heart, everything about this movie is false - except<br /><br />for the amazing photography. I understand that the shots of the<br /><br />Potala (the palace) were smuggled out of Tibet. However,<br /><br />changing a real story about the relationship between two people,<br /><br />one of them very important to this world, in order to build up a<br /><br />movie star is sad|0.36650572344|0.118962826475|0.63349427656

It looked good, the acting was even better, the story of childhood, pain and revenge was interesting and moving. A superior hollywood film. But...No one mentioned this so far (at least in the latest 20 comments), when it came to the courtroom scenes and Brat Pitt´s character followed his plan to rescue his two friends, who are rightly accused of murder, i felt cheated. This movie insulted my intelligence. <br /><br />Warning spoilers!!<br /><br />Why did anyone accept their false alibi, witnessed by the priest? If these two guys had been with him, why shouldn´t they tell this during the investigation? Amnesia? If you were the judge or member of the jury, would you believe it? Is it wise to give the motif of the murderers away?<br /><br />I am sorry, but in the end, the story is very weak, and this angers me.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109424/|Chungking Express (1994)|Be warned! <br /><br />This is crap that other crap wont even deign to be in company with because its beneath them! Okay, got that out of the way, let me say something more substantive.<br /><br />Ive seen Ashes of Time a very long time ago thinking it was a fresh take on the material which is based on a highly revered wuxia tome of a novel due to the emerging reputation of the director, Wong Kar Wai. Well, despite of all of that WKW hasnt succeeded at adapting the novel on screen according to a lot of wuxia fans; mostly it is just shots of dripping water, beads of sweats, legs of horses running, etc. I couldnt sit through most of the movie.<br /><br />Fast forward many years later when I wanted to give Mr. Wongs movies another shot after hearing many praises, especially from Cannes. I was intrigued by his latest, 2046. A friend told me to start w/ Chungking Express because it is his most accessible movies. So wrong! I was just p.o. that I got duped into wasting my time and money on this piece of pretentious nothingness. Some professional reviewers mentioned it as a meditation on alienation and loneliness in a modern big city, blah, blah, blah. Its all fine if the director has a point of view with something to say as to why these things happen and tell it. But no, he merely shows what is. Faye Wongs acting is very typical of Hong Kongs style: garbled enunciation, deer in the headlight wide eye expression, try to be cute and girlish kind of acting; the rest of the cast is equally uninspired.<br /><br />I think the word, Auteur, is a euphemism for a director who tries something new and different, which is to be applauded, but not one who hasnt yet mastered the art of cinematic story telling, which is what Mr. Wong is, for the last 17 years!|0.625342770699|0.151328263402|0.374657229301
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109424/|Chungking Express (1994)|This film is another example of the curse of east Asian cinema: two or more separate stories rolled into one film. Other reviewers have obviously picked up on it as well because there are several mentions of the first part and second part. How can you have any character development or a deep plot when the characters and the story are featured for such a short time? I was enjoying the first part until it abruptly stopped (it didnt end, it just stopped in what appeared to be the middle of the story) to be replaced by an inane and totally unbelievable second part that seemed to focus around a girl rearranging and cleaning a guys apartment (wow!)

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109424/|Chungking Express (1994)|For those deciding whether or not to watch this movie and are reading these comments for insight, I first offer these four words: Dont waste your time! Chungking Express was shoddily filmed, slapped together quickly and seems as though it were conceived in its entirety by someone standing in line at a Hong Kong Burger King. I cant remember ever watching a film with an assortment of such one-dimensional characters trying to work their way through a script this mundane! Its an absurd effort with philosophically ridiculous dialog (a man wanders into his flooded apartment and offers the stunning revelation that tears can be dried with a tissue, but water takes time to mop up). The same character is also seen carrying on a deep, meaningful rapport with his towels, soap, stuffed animals, dirty laundry, etc. The shaky, wandering, hand-held camera-work was another annoying feature I could have done without. And if that isnt enough to make you puke in your popcorn, we hear the old 60s ode California Dreaming by the Mamas and Papas blaring over the soundtrack over and over again during a particularly lengthy sequence.<br /><br />Quentin Tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to America through his Rolling Thunder Productions company, though I cannot for the life of me figure out why a man with his talent would bother. He was known to have remarked, Im happy to love a movie this much. A lot of us, though, hope he will concentrate on making his audiences happy with more worthwhile discoveries in the future.|0.68573324747|0.166666683037|0.31426675253
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109424/|Chungking Express (1994)|I am completely baffled as to why this film is even liked, let alone held in such high regard, especially by so many critics who are, otherwise, quite sensible.<br /><br />There is one key word which describes this film to its core - irritating.<br /><br />The most easily explained example of this is the directors use - or, more accurately, abuse - of music. In the first half, a really dull reggae tune is played about three times (when once is too often). But in the second half, The Mommas And The Papas California Dreamin is played at least seven times, usually at top volume. Godsakes, whether you liked the song or not beforehand, youd be thoroughly sick of it by the end. Just think, some people claim to have seen this film four or five times. This means theyve listened to California Dreamin either 28 or 35 times.....<br /><br />All of this needless hyper-repetition (it contributes nothing to the story) could possibly be excused if the remainder of the film had any lingering merit, or if the story was in any way involving.<br /><br />But it aint.<br /><br />The only aspect I found likeable was Bridgette Lins charging around and still playing Asia The Invincible in a raincoat and sunnies. Even this wore off fairly quickly.<br /><br />Im sure this films undeserved high reputation will convince many poor suckers to go and see it.<br /><br />I can only warn you - if youve never seen a HK movie before, dont start with this one.<br /><br />If you feel compelled to watch it, avoid at all costs seeing it in a cinema. The fast-forward and mute buttons are essential tools for survival here.<br /><br />You have been warned !|0.818546638537|0.125734635735|0.181453361463
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109424/|Chungking Express (1994)|I saw virtually no redeeming qualities in this movie. The only thing I did see was Quentin Tarantinos seeming insane obsession for it... There were some attractive women in this movie and perhaps that is one decent quality. Overall however, I found this movie surrealistic and ridiculous. The hand held film making coupled with slow motion and other cinematic gimmicks I found clumsy and dizzying, even sickening. Overall the music throughout was horrible and repetitive to the extreme as well reminding me of psychological warfare of the U.S. military against various malcontents.<br /><br />The various vignettes that made up the movie are haphazard in their placement and unfulfilling and unresolved in their content and conclusions. A depressing movie (not a true _film_, a term I reserve for true art) that left me with a bad feeling. Do not believe the various people that try and spin this as a romantic comedy though there are certainly isolated elements of both this movie repudiates in content, form, and conclusion any association with this genre.<br /><br />I suggest staying far away notwithstanding the seemingly overwhelming positive views of IMDb and other ratings sources.|0.638699508347|0.137868365634|0.361300491653
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109424/|Chungking Express (1994)|Average viewers looking for any sense of internal coherence in a film should probably give this one a pass. It generates the same feeling as staring at a curious array of individual images that seem to have some relationship one to another, but never coalesce into a totality.<br /><br />While this isolative approach to creating a kind of cinematic montage may appeal to a few students or critics steeped in the inside language of contemporary filmmaking, it is flatly irritating and condescending to us commoners who just fell off the haywagon. An overt avoidance of accessibility may be the intentional hallmark of auteurs like Kar-wai Wong and Tarantino, but to me it comes across as Andy Warhol warmed over. The only redeeming characteristic I find is in the production values, and them there just aint going to cut it all by themselfs.<br /><br />This is one of those productions in which you watch and listen and wait anxiously and in vain for some clever development of an idea or thought to sustain all the remarkable and beautiful individual scenes. Sorry. The calligraphic credits unexpectedly begin to roll just as your interest begins to stir. I get the same big yawn and let-down reading what I guess are very knowledgeable and thorough comments about this film that never lead to anything truly comprehensible. Ideas and images without some external context are not my idea of fun.<br /><br />Call me a philistine roaming the streets of Hong Kong looking for a bowl of chop suey.<br /><br />|0.460209345261|0.168599033823|0.539790654739
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109424/|Chungking Express (1994)|A never ending frenzy of clever visual ironies does not necessarily create an engaging film. The Blonde Wig half of the movie never took off perhaps due to too much self-indulgence by its makers.<br /><br /> The Wong Faye half (featuring a very playful, if Karen Carpenter looking, Faye Wong) holds much more appeal. All the ingredients are there, however, the girl-meets-boy story element takes a back seat to artsy cleverness. Character development is uneven. Emotion is missing.<br /><br /> For music lovers, Wong Fayes Mung Jung Yun (Cantonese version of the Cranberrys smash hit Dreams) is used effectively in Chungking Express. Faye Wong also recorded a Mandarin language version called Zhen Tuo. Both are on CD, although only Mung Jung Yun is found on the official movie soundtrack CD.|0.521543622594|0.225555970579|0.478456377406
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109424/|Chungking Express (1994)|I like a movie that has at least a vestige of a story. This doesnt occur in this movie. Its a series of vignettes with no cohesion.<br /><br />There are scenes of a person collecting pineapple cans. A woman with a blond wig never removes her sun glasses. This woman shoots at other people at the beginning of the movie and we never find out why. She disappears completely after about 30 minutes. There is another coquettish woman who endlessly cleans a mans apartment. There are endless scenes at a fast food joint where the Mamas & Papas California Dreaming is vastly overplayed (I used to like the song). The dialogue is mostly concerned with food (pineapples, chefs salad and ordering drinks). I assume most of the actors gained weight during this movie because a lot of fast food was consumed.<br /><br />There is no passion in this movie because there is no story. This is purportedly a romance - it is no such thing. I just wonder why I didnt hit the Fast-forward. I kept waiting for something significant to happen  it doesnt. Maybe thats the only consolation to this movie - scenes shifted so rapidly that it tricked you into assuming that there was going to be a revelation to all the nonsense.|0.71160353258|0.171373817372|0.28839646742

I found certain parts of this film exceedingly offensive, Zemeckis dumbs down this movie almost to the level of Gump himself . . .maybe that was the point he was trying to make.<br /><br />Watch this film and ask yourself What is Robert Zemeckis saying about what makes a good American? <br /><br />Forrest seems to have made the right choices and been at the right place at the right time for the last 45 years.

Sadly, racism had to come into the picture (literally) and mess it up. The predominantly black production staff couldnt allow the antagonist be black, so they swapped Rutgers and Ice-Ts roles. This was only the start of the downward spiral of this film. Ernest Dickersons news-room approach to directing only verified that this was another affirmative-action job assignment. Master shot, close up, close up. Gads, Whos Line Is It Anyway even uses more creative camera work. Erics rewrite of The Most Dangerous Game is at least an attempt at modernizing the classic tale, but fails to give us any motivations for why the characters are doing this. We are never given the reasons, other than no one will miss these people, why the leader (re-written as Rutger) does these things. Aside from a heart-felt performance by John McGinley, and a fair job by Charles Dutton, do not bother with this one.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107653/|Naked (1993)|Johnny and Jeremy are vampires of sorts. Minus the fangs, of course. Theyre dark, bitter creatures with nothing better to do than to spread their own misery. Through their charms (namely a sharp tongue and a fat wallet, respectively) they seduce desperate souls, who they proceed to torment and victimize. Thats more or less the basis of this black comedy, as I understand it.<br /><br />Its not a blend of black humor that I can easily subscribe to, partly because it bothers me to imagine the audience rooting for the sleazy, main character. I did enjoy, however, the sound and the melody of the rapid-fire (and supposedly very witty) remarks. I was very impressed by the casts strong acting, particularly David Theliss; only the character of Jeremy seemed too bi-dimensional. The photography and the music, both dramatic and somber, work very well together. <br /><br />What really turns me off about Naked (and the main reason Id never recommend it to anyone) is the way it repeatedly seems to present misogyny as a valid way to vent ones angst. In other words, in a world that sucks so bad, what difference does it make if one inflicts some pain on girls, right? To suggest (as some have on this website) that Johnny is not so unkind a person because hes not as rough on girls as Jeremy, seems completely absurd to me. Theyre both terrible, nasty people. And theyre particularly keen on hurting women every single time they get a chance. One could argue that Johnny eventually gets what he deserves, as if his bad karma suddenly swung straight back and bit him in the ass. But still, his and Jeremys sadistic behavior are treated to a certain degree as a laughing matter. And I could be wrong, but Im guessing that most people who absolutely love this movie also find that aspect of the film darkly comical.|0.20825032371|0.154630440573|0.79174967629
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107653/|Naked (1993)|Just emailed a friend whos in film school about this flick. Something to avoid when making a film - characters blabbering senseless, overwrought, convoluted monologues on screen that are ultimately trite and unconvincing. If the film is an attempt at social realism, these verbal barrages are so over-the-top that they actually draw attention to the film constructed as film and effectively neutralize that intent. Is it the acting, or the script that is bad, or both?<br /><br />The protagonist is also highly unbelievable for social realism - ravenously consuming canonical English literature and the bible while high or hungover and able to produce such profoundly sophomoric soliloquies while intoxicated? And how is such an unattractive, unwashed and verbally noxious character able to bed most of the women he meets within minutes of encountering them? (I had to applaud when one chick finally threw him out onto the street, despite his whining and self-pitying banter).<br /><br />The viewer encounters pretentious references to Ancient Greek literature, Nostradamus and the Book of Revelations. The impending doom of mankind, in the form of bar codes imprinted on our foreheads or right hands in spooky biblical fashion, is presented to a character who is oh-so-cleverly exposed in his role as a guardian of empty space. <br /><br />This flick is over-scripted and over the top - a melodrama clumsily infused with pedestrian philosophy about the meaning of mankind, life, etc. It is trite, overwrought and tedious.<br /><br />There are some very fine English films available with content similar to this film. Nil by Mouth is an excellent, far more interesting excursion into the lives of individuals in a similar social milieu. Ditto for In the Warzone. And although the comparison is not even warranted, check out anything by Peter Greenaway, who far more deftly handles dialogue, wit and absurd characters and situations.|0.558776338781|0.164060420478|0.441223661219

I did get a kick out of the fact that the opposing gang, having lost their wheels due to their gambling habits in the original Grease, were forced to use motorcycles in the second movie.

Although in the previous film Olivia Newton St. Johns foreign speech pattern is not explained, its explained here Caulfield is her cousin. Whats Conn still doing in school, I guess she just likes hanging around Rydell High even though now shes a beautician.<br /><br />Caulfields a smart kid, so of course the hood types led by Adrian Zmed have him labeled as a nerd. And thats especially bad when Zmeds girl friend decides she likes Caulfield. But being a nerd just isnt going to cut it.<br /><br />Thats when Caulfield decides to put on a modern day Zorro act. He gets a junked bicycle and puts it back together and teaches himself to ride. He gets himself a leather biker outfit with a set of goggles to hide his face. If getting Michelle Pheiffer is not in the cards, Caulfield wont have any trouble making friends at any gay male leather bar the way hes outfitted.<br /><br />Grease 2 introduced Michelle Pheiffer and Maxwell Caulfield and started them on the successful career paths both have enjoyed. If you saw the first Grease film, a much better film, than you definitely have an idea how this film will turn out.<br /><br />In addition to Conn, Eve Arden, Sid Caesar, and Dody Goodman, all faculty members from the original Grease return in their roles.

The major scenes, when included at all, are glossed over, combined, and put out of order in such a way that they completely change the storyline. There was so little transition or even scene development that it would be difficult for anyone not familiar with the story even to follow. The big disappointment was that the beginning opened so much hope, and then the end dashed it.|0.736593624862|0.182051690116|0.263406375138

At last, I thought, someone will make this book into a movie following the story actually written by the author. Wrong!!! If the casting director was intending to cast a Jane who was plain he certainly succeeded. However, surely he could have found one who could also act. Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester? Where was the spooky suspense of the novel when the laughter floated into the night seemingly from nowhere? Where was the sparkle of the child who flirted and danced like her mother? Finally, why was the plot changed at the end? One wonders whether the screenwriters had actually read the book.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116684/|Jane Eyre (1996)|I love the book, Jane Eyre and have seen many versions of it. All have their strong points and their faults. However, this was one of the worst I have seen. I didnt care about Jane or Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Gainsbourg (Jane) was almost tolerable and certainly looked the plain part, but she had no emotion in any of her lines. I couldnt imagine what Mr. Rochester saw in her. <br /><br />That brings us to Mr. Rochester. William Hurt had even less emotion than Jane, if that were possible. How two such insipid people could fall in love is a mystery, but it certainly didnt hold my attention. Perhaps the director (Zeffrelli) fell asleep during the production.<br /><br />The Timothy Dalton (too handsome for Mr. Rochester!) version is far more faithful to the book, but Ciaran Hinds plays the perfect Mr. Rochester in the 1997 A/E version (which is NOT all that true to the book).<br /><br />Trying to find something positive about this movie: Geraldine Chaplain was perfect in her role.|0.551963902148|0.105903795541|0.448036097852

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116684/|Jane Eyre (1996)|Having read the novel before seeing this film, I was enormously disappointed by the wooden acting and the arrogance of the producers in their blatant disregard of the plot. I feel this film in no way reflects the brilliance of Brontes work, and rather gave the impression of a shallow love story. In the condensing of the film to a short 2hours, the film lost many of the key features which make the book comprehendable and progressional, thus resulting in a somewhat jumpy plot with little grounding. There is no build up to the romance between Rochester and Jane Eyre, so this appears rather abrupt and unfounded since the two characters have such infrequent interaction you cannot help but imagine their love is superficial. This is such an injustice to Brontes novel;you are given no impression of Janes quirky cheek and boldness which attracts Rochester to her, and his arrogance which attracts Jane to him.<br /><br />Despite to poor scripting, I think that a few of the characters were portrayed very astutely, namely Mrs Fairfax and Grace Poole, however overall the production was poor. Given a better scripting, perhaps the film would have been more successful. See Jane Eyre (1970) with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton for an outstanding production.|0.563084737455|0.16080960138|0.436915262545

It has been about 24years since I read the book as it was in school. But I felt that you would need to know the story of Jane Eyre when watching this one as bits are left out & therefore it doesnt fully make sense. For example Jane & Mr Rochester have hardly spoken & suddenly he is proposing marriage!!! The actors dont have time to let the audience know how their character feels about each thing happening in the story.The actors are good but arent given enough time to do this story justice. Im sorry to say it but I didnt really enjoy this version.The 1970 version with Susanna York & George C Scott would be the Jane Eyre movie of my preference BUT you should check out the 1983 BBC mini series version with Zelah Clarke & Timothy Dalton in the 2 main roles.

Was Hollywood responsible for this travesty, or can I take comfort in the idea that someone who didnt speak English as a first language just completely missed the point of Charlotte Brontes classic? I dont think I can improve on a comment I read below, so Ill just paraphrase it: Jane Eyre is a great great book, the screenwriter should read it sometime. Its true that this movies two leads were sadly miscast. But pity the actors, because the screenwriter left out all of the best scenes. The dialog that makes you understand the Jane and Rochester have a meeting of minds and a shared sense of fun...deleted from the script. The marriage proposal, the fortune teller...gone. The allusions, half joking, half sincerely felt, to Jane as a fairy sprite from olde England come to rescue Rochester in his despair...eliminated.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that Zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and Janes interactions with the Rivers family. But it is unforgivable that he has surgically removed the love from one of the best love stories ever written.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and go find the 1983 (?) mini series with Timothy Dalton.|0.510222009798|0.180720838017|0.489777990202

I also cant believe that they eliminated Edwards great marriage proposal scene from the end of the book, one of the most moving moments in literature. I do appreciate that they finally used such a young, plain woman to play Jane, a character who is supposed to be a worldly 18, but if you want to see a version that closer approximates the personalities and passions of the novel, please see the 70s version with George C.

I was deeply disappointed to find that this movie, which seemed to be either written or filmed in great haste, had not the qualities that made the original novel so powerful. Much of the witty back and forth between the main characters, Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester, seemed to be either missing from the screenplay or left on the cutting room floor. Also missing was Jane Eyres charismatic sense of self, which enabled her to suffer through her turmoil and triumph over all. The original Jane Eyre was a hero. The woman in this movie did not seem to have much to triumph over, including one of the greatest parts of the story when Jane runs away from Thornfield and Mr. Rochester. Her struggle to find food and shelter, her shame at having to beg for bread, the threat of freezing to death in the cold, all to get away from a man she loved were, in my opinion, poignant parts of the story that were simply left out of this movie. The title character seemed dry and uninspired. The story was unappealing and for those who did not read the book, I cannot imagine that this story would be the least bit interesting.

Rock Hudson is his usual prototype of Barbie Doll Ken and makes one wonder what a, say, Redford could have done with the male lead. There is no discernible plot that provides any tension until the final twenty minutes, just a pastiche of milestones that have little relationship to each other. Except for Hopper, there is no character development, only a collection of cardboard cutouts that pop up periodically for no discernible reason like random targets in a shooting gallery. To its credit, the film does tackle racism and sexism at a time when they were taboo subjects, and it does have SIZE, making it an excellent choice for ridding yourself of unwelcome house guests.

There are obvious problems; for example, after taking what seems to be weeks and weeks to get from fat to normal size, the main character seems to go from normal size to deathly thin in days... and once hes deathly thin he stays pretty much equally deathly thin for what seems to be a long time.<br /><br />In any case, the movie has far worse problems than that--the cinematography is decidedly low-budget-TV-show quality and most of all the acting is pretty awful all around. Robert John Burke seems to always be trying for some kind of weird snarling Charlton Heston impersonation and is literally painful to watch... the only scary thing is that Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are both even worse.<br /><br />The only reason why Im giving this movie as high as I am is that once the movie enters its last 1/3 or so and Joe Mantegnas character takes over, the movie develops a fun, campy cheesefest slaughterhouse feel, and the gangsters crazy schemes for tormenting the totally obnoxious gypsies are somewhat fun to watch.

If you have read the book, there are zero surprises, no changes, no altering of scenes or characters.

Rober John Berk cannot act to save his life and neither can any of the others. A few of the performances even made me laugh out loud! The film was was not as I imagined it, after reading the book which was awesome, I imagined it darker and a lot scarier. If i was Stephen, I would be really mad!<br /><br />I dont know why they changed the ending, I thought the ending of the book was very good. If you just found out the pie killed your daughter, you wouldnt feed it to anyone else would you?!<br /><br />Book was so much better!|0.535664710679|0.114003268727|0.464335289321
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117894/|Thinner (1996)|Just another example of why Stepehn Kings books should not be made into movies. (Even Carrie, one of the best, is ruined in the adaptation from book to screen.) The premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer, always on a diet, who accidentally kills an old gypsy woman. In court, with the help of the judge and the local police chief, he gets off, even though the accident was sort of his fault as he was not paying attention as he was driving. The father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse on the 3, with our main character, Billy (the lawyer) getting thinner and thinner by the day. Though the movie kept with the book, for the most part, and has your typical King ending, the acting was stilted and felt forced. We went from one scene to the next without much of anything in between, sort of like reading acts in a play. King himself made a cameo in the movie (sort of like Dave Barry), which reinforces my belief that authors should stay just that: authors. Leave the acting to actors. Not that anyone in this movie was that great. Ive seen the major characters in movies where they were much better.|0.617920260223|0.60497997646|0.382079739777
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108358/|Tombstone (1993)|After finally viewing this movie in its entirety, I am completely mystified by the adoration it has received by critics and online users alike. Is it the worst Western ever? No, I wouldnt say that. But the last great American Western, a phrase I saw applied to it more than once? Not even close.<br /><br />A movie that tries to tell a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue, and the dialogue in this film is among the most hackneyed and clichéd that Ive ever seen. The movie can be measured in groaners per minute; as in, how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life? Theres so many instances of this that its distracting. Cheesy lines come at you in waves; predictable, unoriginal, and often. <br /><br />If bad dialogue doesnt bother you, then how about bad gunfights? Few Westerns can show you gunfighting thats completely unbelievable while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously. Its okay if theres a comic edge to such gunfighting, such as in Silverado, but in Tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie off the list of good Westerns. The final showdown somewhat redeems the director on this score, but by then, I was so disinterested in the movie that it was beyond saving.<br /><br />Other than those flaws, I can say the visuals are stunning - the movies well shot and the settings all look great. The acting is passable, especially considering what the actors were given to work with. However, if youre looking for the last great American Western, do yourself a favor - go rent Unforgiven instead.<br /><br />3 out of 10|0.550206528964|0.205555558688|0.449793471036

If nothing catastrophic happens before I die, this will be the biggest regret of my life. Who ever even thought about this movie, or financed deserves a kick between the legs, because thats where they were thinking when they made this movie. Its about an overweight guy who is a hopeless romantic, and writes pretentious drivel that tries to pass off as poetry. He joins his amorous friend in a trip to the coast. Where they meet girls and such. Only the fat guy doesnt get a girl. Skin flicks dont annoy me, I take em for face value. But this movie tries to be more than a skin flick. Its about Fat guy looking for love in some girl, but then meets another bikini silicone girl that enjoys his poetry. He finds his talent for volleyball which gets money for his family and impresses the ladies, only he has his lady anyways. The dialogue is super-horrible for even a C movie. It supports a ton of black stereotypes, no character development, its a glorified porno movie, without any porn in it. Never ever watch this movie.|0.871837595274|0.180002707921|0.128162404726

The rest of the characters are just various stereotypes of young men and young black men. I like to watch these low budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the years attitudes and fads. Phat Beach is also funny because the low-budget babes in this movie are strictly home-girls. Most low-budget movies have that local babe quality, and you can tell the babes in this movie were the local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys. Some of them had so much cellulite hanging from their bikinis that it was funny to watch how the youngsters went wild over what was essentially some really over-used, high-mileage skank. There were some cuties too. That is the charm of these low-budget crappy movies. You will see a lot of doggies, and some real cuties! I checked up on some of them at IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach is their only credit. Too bad. It would be interesting if someone ever managed to do a Where are they now book on all of the cuties that have appeared in the history of movies and then were never again to return. What happened?? There are probably one or two young people in almost every movie who seem to have a lot going for them and yet years later when you see the movie again on TV you wonder what ever happened to X?

I had high expectations about the film before I rented it and maybe that is why I disliked it so much. I admire Spaceys attempt at making a film that takes place mostly in one small setting, but its not the attempt that counts. I found the film dull, boring, and stretched out. The acting was nothing spectacular. Gary Sinise has done much better, especially since he is conscious in most of his other films. Skeet Ulrich was disappointing, but this was one of his first films (I did get a kick out of how young and chubby this Scream star looked). The only thing that impressed me about this film was the one shot of the car wreck from above. The center line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera moved on along the line and past the wreck. However, that shot was very Usual Suspectsish and my guess is Spacey got the idea from that earlier film of his (which is very good mind you). If you want to see a fabulous film that takes place in one small setting, watch Hitchcocks Lifeboat. Maybe Spacey should have watched it before filming this.|0.719945019797|0.149341789665|0.280054980203
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115495/|Albino Alligator (1996)|A trio of low-life criminals, led by Matt Dillon, botches a late-night burglary. They flee but quickly cross paths with the police who just happen to be in hot pursuit of a terrorist. Of course the police mistake the burglar gang for the terrorist, the real terrorist gets away, and the burglars are forced to take refuge in a small dive of a bar, taking hostages, unaware why the police are so intent on catching them. And guess who else has picked the bar as a sanctuary for the night?<br /><br />Unbelievable? Absolutely. And it goes down hill from there. Spacey did acquire a good bit of acting talent; Matt Dillon, Faye Dunaway, Gary Sinise, Viggo Mortensen, and M. Emmett Walsh, but theyre all wasted. Mostly because after all the characters get stuck in the bar, all they do for the remainder of the film is argue. Endlessly and aimlessly.

This movie fails on so many levels. In a film where there is not much action and most of the scenes are shot in a couple of locations, it is imperative that suspense and continuity are provided by the director. Not so here, the great cast is horribly under-used, none more so than the great, late John Spencer, the plot is so run of the mill and nothing you havent seen in a hundred other TV movies. There is so little character development you end up not caring for any of the protagonists.

The cast is totally wasted here and the southern accents are very annoying and forced. Nick Noltie plays the wimpiest lawyer in history who would ever believe he can defend anyone ! De Niros psychotic Bowden is nothing more than the typical 90s movie psycho killer.

Not that a typical thriller is realistic but this one seemed to be trying to, and yet the woman who got rapped didnt press charges because she didnt want to be cross examined in a court even though she would be putting the man who broke her arm beat the crap out of her and raped her away for life not but also protecting the lawyer whom she had feelings for and his family not just random people she didnt even know. There were other similar problems with the movie which would have been all right if there was some kind of moral to take away from the movie but the few moral questions like whether it was right to try to kill/beat Kady before he did anything illegal were presented a little one sided since Kady ended up being just a crazed bastard bent on revenge so sure the lawyer was justified in protecting his family since waiting for Kady to actually rape his daughter so he could do something legally about it would be a bit absurd.

How anyone could have the audacity to even attempt to replicate the Phil Silvers character is beyond me. To compound things the exercise was repeated in Martins unfunny attempt to be Peter Sellers Inspector Clouseau, another abortive attempt, in my opinion, to rekindle a demonstrably unfunny career.

No one, man or woman can do anything they want to do, and unfortunately Demi Moore buffing up for SEAL Hell Week in the early 27 week BUD/S program by a few sessions at the local gym and her desire alone to be a SEAL is simply not going to make it so. There is approximately an 80% dropout rate in what is arguably THE roughest military training program - those are the ones who voluntarily drop out, cant compete on a physical level, suffer frequent physical injury during the training or cant handle the psychological harassment. I never got beyond the shallowness of the contrived, purported message of this film. In the real world, Demi wouldnt last the first 24 hours in this harsh and sustained physical training. Wishing alone wont do it. Skip this film as wishful thinking, and better spend your time reading The Warrior Elite by Dick Couch (Crown, New York 2001)for the best description as to what really goes on in this training. Ring the bell, Demi!<br /><br />|0.854760085769|0.239596057382|0.145239914231
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119173/|G.I. Jane (1997)|This is easily the worst Ridley Scott film. Ridley Scott is a wonderful director. But this film is a black mark on his career. Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen, both totally miscast in an overaggressive film about a girl going to the army. Very stupid. And there is never one scene that is convincing in any way. It is really not difficult to make a film such as this. Everything the crew makes could have been an idea of just anybody. The writers didnt have much inspiration either; many foolish dialogs that made no sense at all; and some brainless action. I strongly recommend to stay away from this rubbish. I hope that the many talented persons involved in this project realize this type of film does not deserve their attention, and that in the future they will work on more honorable and more intelligent movies than this useless mess.|0.792370743909|0.0691496426058|0.207629256091

Here Demi Moore sweats a lot and theres high music and we get to see her fight and everything, but it is certainly not very engaging. I really think the idea behind the film is kind of interesting, but the script is too clichéd and Ridley Scott cant do anything about that. Well, like I said... Its better than Flashdance...

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119173/|G.I. Jane (1997)|A real disappointment from the great visual master Ridley Scott. G.I. Jane tells the story of a first female ever to go through the hellish training at the Navy SEALs. The training is the most difficult and hard in existence as the instructor says in the film to the lead character ONeil played by Demi Moore. There is no particular message or point in this film or then I couldnt reach it properly. It may be a some kind of a statement of female rights and abilities but it all sinks under the tired scenes and stupid gun fight at the end of the film.<br /><br />I really cant understand why Ridley uses so much zooms in that mentioned last gun battle at the desert?! It looks sooooo stupid and irritating and almost amateurish so I would really like to know what the director saw in that technique. When I look at his latest film, Black Hawk Dawn, there is absolutely nothing wrong in the battle scenes (which are plenty) and they are very intense and directed with skill. The whole finale in G.I. Jane looks ugly and is nothing more but stupid and brainless shooting and killing.<br /><br />This is Ridley Scotts worst movie in my opinion and there are no significant touches from which this great director is known. Still Im glad I saw this in Widescreen format because there are still couple of great scenes and samples of Scotts abilities, but they are very few in this film.<br /><br />A disappointment and nothing compared to the classics (Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Alien and so on..) of this talented director.

Of course if you are interested in the crapstory (Demi Moore just wants to prove that a woman can be part of the NAVY Seals) that is the most stupid cliché one I can think of, youll say GI Jane is a great movie. Just the performance from Viggo Mortensen made this movie bearable but hell, I cant think of Demi Moore being Rambo (especially not during the last, useless, 30 minutes). Ridley Scott doesnt deserve the credits to make this movie one that comes up for women with equal rights, its just brainless propaganda for the American army and to make it more attractive they dropped Moore in it.

Jane (1997)|A recent post here by a woman claiming a military background, contained the comment A womans life is no more valuable than a mans.<br /><br />This mantra of the politically correct is not true as history as well as biology show. Societies have managed to recover from heavy losses of their male population, sometimes with astonishing speed. Germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite the 1914- 1918 war in which over two million of her men were killed. In South Americas War of the Triple Alliance (1865), Paraguay took on three neighboring countries until virtually her entire male population was wiped out but fought to a stalemate in the 1932 Chaco War against much larger Bolivia.<br /><br />No society, however has or ever could survive the loss of its female population. Only when the very life of the nation is at stake are women sent to fight. Israel faced that situation in 1948 but since then has never considered coed combat units for its Defense Forces despite the popular image of the Israeli girl soldier.<br /><br />G.I.

I was more or less forced to watch this film round my ex-girlfriends house.<br /><br />GI Jane loses its credibility straight away by trying to convince the viewer that it is potentially a real scenario, which of course it isnt. The result of this is that the story becomes automatically bound by constraints, restricting the amount of humour (of which there is none) or entertaining action scenes, and soon becomes too serious. The film therefore becomes extremely boring and predictable.<br /><br />GI Jane fails where other action films succeed, mainly because films such as James Bond, Dirty Harry and various others are larger than life, yet never proclaim to be otherwise. They are escapism, and therefore entertaining. GI Jane tries to be real and fails.<br /><br />This is a very disappointing film from Ridley Scott, with a very non-credible storyline, unremarkable acting, and the only reason I give it 2/10 instead of 1/10 is for some of the technical work.|0.748586753334|0.192077600089|0.251413246666

The acting, primarily Moores, is just terrible. The woman cannot act. Nice tits, but she just cant act. At no point did she come across as the actual character. Instead, it was spoiled Hollywood actress goes to the beach to play make-believe with the boys.<br /><br />And thats what this movie ultimately is -- Hollywood make-believe.

How can the Muppets go from the sublime Christmas Carol to this? The humour was dreadful, the songs were worse than Country and Western (and thats saying something) and the plot was as confused and poor as Blind Pew. I think the main problem was that they bit off too much in attempting Treasure Island.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117110/|Muppet Treasure Island (1996)|The Treasure Island DVD should be required viewing in any film production course! Its a textbook example of how NOT to make a movie. Watching the movie and then listening to the writer/directors commentary demonstrates graphically the vast chasm between what he knows about the characters and what he communicates to his audience about them. Call me old-fashioned, but I think of movies as a means of communication, and communication isnt complete if the audience doesnt know what the hell the director is talking about. The directors avowed purpose is to make a movie void of Hollywood conventions. Among those conventions, alas, is consistency of character and clarity of concept. The director himself realizes that audiences often dont understand points where he has purposely avoided a Hollywood cliché. However, he never seems to grasp the idea that clichés exist for a reason. They are shorthand for conveying complex ideas quickly and clearly. Its fine to avoid them, but they need to be replaced with some other way of communicating the same idea, not simply eliminated. The film is built on an intriguing premise, rich with potential. Two puppets are assigned to fabricate a personality and background for an unidentified corpse that is to be used in a disinformation mission in the closing days of WWII. Soon each begins to populate their personal fantasies with the character and their invention becomes increasingly real to them. Someone with less disdain for the Hollywood convention of traditional storytelling could create a wonderful film with this idea. This film certainly isnt it! The puppets do everything they can to bring consistency to these characters, but they are all too often defeated by the dazed and confused script. In particular, Im becoming increasingly impressed by Gonzo, who plays the lively corpse. In a number of muppet films, he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet.|0.48561569792|0.122979816474|0.51438430208
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113158/|Georgia (1995)|Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are a good match portraying vastly different siblings, but only Winningham is able to bring something convincing or substantial to her role. Leigh, playing bar-band singer and alcoholic Sadie Flood, constantly leans on older sis Georgia, an acclaimed folk singer in the Joni Mitchell mold. Perhaps due to her double duties as co-producer on the film, Leigh seems to have boxed herself into a corner: she isnt credible as a singer and, even if this is intentional, gives herself far too much screen-time at the microphone. Probably hoping for a tour-de-force, Leigh is wire-drawn and nervous and jagged; however, we simply do not see any talent within this character (Leigh is obviously a solid actress, but she makes decisions here that wall us off from her). If Sadie had even the slightest bit of charisma or appeal, we might be able to buy into the concept that she gets the (small) breaks that she does. As it is, the likelihood of her ever getting up on stage is slim. Director Ulu Grosbard crafts a few intense dramatic sequences, and the editing at the finale juxtaposes Sadies bar performance with Georgias sold-out arena show--both singing the same song--and its a sadly nuanced moment...but really, whats the point? *1/2 from ****|0.406444411859|0.228286028185|0.593555588141

He had that innocence but at the same time, he was strong as well.<br /><br />This new kid, Alex? Annoying as all hell! Just a blatant ripoff at trying to match Culkins charm and grace, failing miserably at that.<br /><br />The villains, complete crap. Harry and Marv, they were such an entertaining on screen team.

These guys Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, absolutely PERFECT for those roles. On the other hand, in 3, we have 4 new idiots that just bicker and again, try to capitalize on the charisma and duo charm of the first villains. Not saying they were horrible, but they were not memorable or even really that entertaining. More on the corny side actually.<br /><br />Then we got the actual movies. Part 1 and 2, classics.

If only I saw a trailer, Id be able to tell you the whole plot of the movie; I could have saved myself the most pointless one hour and forty minutes in my entire life, and about twenty dollars. This movie was a disaster waiting to happen, and it is an embarrassment to Hollywood.<br /><br />The movie displays a vivid ignorance of reality. For example, this kids remote control race car goes all over the neighborhood, and even enters this house. Its even covered with clothes. Is it not rational to believe that a remote can no longer transmit a signal under those circumstances? Hollywood obviously did not believe so. Common logic and any concept of electronics dictates the opposite; I doubt the race car could even have reached the street, let alone a house across the street. Another unrealistic trait is the lack of intelligence the criminals possess. Why is it in all these movies, these criminals are rocket scientists until they encounter an eight-year old? The kid is meant to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorists? Please, theres more reality in The Matrix. Also, the leader puts down his real pistol and accidentally picks up a plastic pistol; apparently, he could not tell the difference. Even with a glove on, one should be able to do that. Just because they look the same does not mean anything; there is other senses then sight. The traps are unrealistic as well; if any one of them actually worked, the criminals would be dead. But, Hollywood intends for us to laugh at the funny results of the traps. I did not laugh; I sighed and rolled my eyes.<br /><br />But, I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they have seen a really bad movie; the movie they saw will seem like Citizen Kane compared to this one. Otherwise, skip this one for the sake of your pride. Home Alone 3 also raises a question. We all know Alex D.

Four industrial spies acquire a missile guidance system computer chip and smuggle it through an airport inside a remote controlled toy car. Because of baggage confusion, grouchy Mrs. Hess (Marian Seldes) gets the car. She gives it to her neighbor, Alex (Linz), just before the spies turn up.

The slapstick humour is consistent as well, but the young boy and the villains really fail to make an impact in this film. (No pun intended.) This film offers nothing new or different than the previous films did, and there really is not the warm, holiday feeling or subplots that the other two films had.

Most of the cast seemed to be capable of acting but the juvenile script and direction make it a waste of time. This movie sucks on so many different levels it never had a chance. I was almost embarrassed to watch it. The way you would be embarrassed to see a friend make a fool of himself when he was drunk. Like seeing someone at a very low point in his or her life. After watching it I had to look up what Ebert said about it and marvel at the fact he liked it. Most movies these days are awful. I guess if youre movie reviewer you cant write bad reviews on everything. At the end I thought it might have a twist to save it somewhat.

The story line and plot twists are very Thomas, but the characters seemed a little one-dimensional. He is great at building characters in his novels, but there just isnt enough time to do that in a movie. I needed to see vulnerability in each character, when all that was given was cold calculation (which even the hardest CIA agent is NOT).<br /><br />The sex scenes seemed forced, and I bet that they werent in the original script. Thomas doesnt need to use sex to relate characters to each other, but its a quick gimmie for the film.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to any Ross Thomas fan, especially given that it was probably the last thing he wrote before he died. Otherwise, watch it if youre into mystery, but know that its not very thrilling, and can move slowly at times.|0.498714205217|0.132265023237|0.501285794783
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112443/|Bad Company (1995)|Its not the company you keep but the one you work for at issue here in this taut film about an ex-CIA agent who goes to work for a company that specializes in helping their corporate clients get the upper hand in any and all situations by any means necessary, but especially blackmail, as the central plot revolves around soborning a judge who has severely compromised his integrity by mounting up impressive gambling debts and extra-marital infidelity. Ellen Barkin plays the devious (bad) company recruiter who signs on ex agent Laurence Fishbourne whose 140 IQ proves no match for her physical talents. By bribing the compromised judge (David Ogden Stiers) they will rescue their client Walter Curl (Spalding Grey) from a lawsuit that claims that his company dumped cancer causing pollutants. Though the judge is a gambling philanderer, hes in nobodys pocket, and thus, after taking the bribe, votes his conscience on the case in question, and then opts out after sending his girlfriend (Gia Carides) to the Bahamas with the money. Meanwhile Barkin maneuvers Fishbourne through sex into killing company head Frank Langella, showing that IQ comes in a distant second to sex appeal. Nobody (except maybe Carides and Stiers, and to a certain extent Fishbourne) is going to win much sympathy from the audience, but the story stays on task all the way through, and the observations it casts on corportate behavior are not so far out.|0.611000189707|0.860229417867|0.388999810293

This is a very tough and cynical thriller, one that has no good guys, only a whole lotta bad guys and a couple of not quite as bad guys. But thats what I enjoyed about this film. It was great to see the plot unfold in unexpected ways, and to see these characters mess with one another, motivated only by greed, lust, and fear. Another aspect is the films sleek and cold style. From the wardrobes to the apartments these characters occupy, the film is pretty stylin. And the acting is very good. Laurence Fishburne is excellent as the amoral Crowe, Frank Langella is elegantly nasty as Grimes, and Michael Beach has a deceptively quiet role as one of Fishburnes co-workers. A very dark film that resolves itself quite nicely in the end, and well worth seeing.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114367/|Screamers (1995)|Im a big fan of Philip K. Dick, and so I already knew the basic story behind Screamers. (it was based on a short story of his). On seeing the film, I was satisfied with the way that they managed to work around the originals cold war trappings. Also, despite the low budget, the effects were sufficiently good to suspend disbelief. In fact, the attention to detail (surroundings, back-ground, odd gadgets etc.) was excellent, as is important in all sci-fi films...by creating a coherent world, the movie becomes that much more convincing. The performances were excellent, for such a low budget, and some of the lines were very quotable (up there with the script of Aliens if you ask me). This is always an advantage. However, right at the end, I felt a little let down by the love-scene. It kind of destroyed Philip k. Dicks message. Nevertheless, I managed to overlook that, considering how much fun it was.<br /><br />This film is no classic, but its well worth a look.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114367/|Screamers (1995)|Stories by Philip K. Dick always get transformed into good science fiction films. First there was Blade Runner, then came Total Recall and now we have Screamers.<br /><br />Screamers is fairly low-budgeted (I think around 10 - 12 million dollars), but it is really, really good. The script is ace because its written by Dan OBannon (Alien, Total Recall), and the director knows exactly what hes doing. It stars Peter Weller (from RoboCop), and he really shines as an actor in this film. Andy Lauer, who plays the rookie who is ironically nicknamed Ace, is also very good, as are Roy Dupois who plays the mysterious Becker, and Jennifer Rubin who plays Jessica.<br /><br />The story is interesting and has a sense of paranoia, because you never know who is a Screamer (a killer robot), and who isnt. The futuristic sets of a war-ravaged planet are also excellent, and the costumes and props to go with it are good too.<br /><br />The only thing that lets it down are the special effects. For some parts they are ok, like the spaceship taking off at the end. But the rest are not so good, such as the stop-motion Screamers that are outdated and when Becker gets shot in half.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a very good movie. If it had a slightly higher budget to sort out those special effects it would get full marks, but as it is I give it 8/10.|0.395167975407|0.103355447723|0.604832024593

Christian Duguay, Dan OBannon and Philip K. Dick did a fair job at a movie that has a decent jab at the sci-fo genre. Although one of the lesser sci-fis(in my opinion) the storyline would have to be one of the best and the characters fit in perfectly. Peter Weller does a splendid job as Hendricksson. His acting performance is probably up there with his robocop one and it probably lifted his career to new heights. Special effects impress for 1995, as this helps lift Screamers to new heights. A good movie for anyone who wants a creepy sci-fi. <br /><br />Overall: 70%|0.109292144465|0.160765248893|0.890707855535

Philip K. Dicks stories adapted to film have previously been great successes, like Blade Runner and Total Recall. So why Duguay and OBannon chose to rewrite the ending completely into one of the worst cases of Hollywood Happy Ending Ive ever seen, and in doing so completely removing the the ENTIRE plot of the original story, leaves me a bit provoked.<br /><br />My vote: 4 out of 10|0.630540074566|0.117616550386|0.369459925434

Peter Weller is perfect for his role and develops great repartee with the greenie who tags along with him to... some pretty nice matte paintings. Budgetary constraints aside the movie looks good, the spaceships look good, the robots look good, and this is simply the kind of unified enterprise that doesnt get made with $100,000,000 and Bruckheimer producing (what is it with the Germans?

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114367/|Screamers (1995)|On a desolate planet, two factions are at war with each other, but there is another menace out there tunneling beneath the ground. An autonomous mobile sword, or screamer, is an incredibly quick weapon named for its high-pitched shrieking, and which cuts its victims into pieces. It turns out, these weapons seem to be evolving on their own, and become capable of taking on new forms.<br /><br />Based on a Philip K. Dick novel (his works have also inspired the films Blade Runner and Total Recall), this is better than your run-of-the-mill, filmed-in-Canada B-movie. Slowly, deliberately paced, dialog heavy, subtle, and atmospheric, its rewarding for those who stick with it. It looks quite impressive - special effects are excellent, rarely ever getting overtly cheesy - and the indoor / outdoor sets and location work are phenomenal. The snowy, windswept landscape is photographed quite well. Overall, its quite a nice film to look at.<br /><br />Co-scripted by Dan OBannon of Alien fame, that gives it some extra punch, as he always tends to do quite well in the realm of science-fiction. The acting is good - Peter Weller is a stalwart, and refreshingly, not one-note, hero, and is supported capably by Roy Dupuis (The Rocket), Andy Lauer, and the lovely Jennifer Rubin (A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, Bad Dreams). Some of the characters are abrasive, although that thankfully never became too much of a distraction. The story twists are actually not ones that really surprised me, but I appreciated the story-telling in general.<br /><br />Screamers *is* a nice little surprise, worth looking into for science-fiction buffs who have yet to see it. Its bleak, chilly, interesting, and reasonably entertaining stuff. I recommend it.<br /><br />7/10|0.201557479978|0.136974939079|0.798442520022

I had two movies that I wanted to rent, but the 2nd movie was out. So I browsed the movies and picked this one since it had an interesting name & Peter Weller was in it. Screamers was a last choice rental. Im glad I rented this movie, it was a lot better than the box office movies I rented. True this movie has a very low budget but thats what makes it great. It has the great sorta feel of (John Carpenters The Thing). Its a desolete kind of movie. The acting in this movie is good, especially by Peter Weller. This movie is about the morality of machines made by man to fight other men, and then all of man fighting evolving machines that want to be like man, that use mans weaknesses against man. The premise is very intelligent, and the amount of action is perfect for the story to unfold. This movie will make you think! Well, It made me think. This movie is quite entertaining and is one of my all time favorites. It could of been improved a little bit but only by the supporting casts acting. If this movie had a large or very large budget, it would have been made for larger group of the masses, and therefore it would have sucked!

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114367/|Screamers (1995)|Contemporary releases in sci-fi/horror genre prove that rich Hollywood filmmakers are running out of ideas. This film is really an excellent example of how you can do a great job with almost no money.<br /><br />The greatest thing in Screamers is that there is a message in it. Its just a way the real art should be - it should make people think, dream, use their imagination and not only consume the finished and totally digested pieces of information. And I think not many expensive Hollywood productions (especially sci-fi) are successful in this regard.<br /><br />So, for instance, the idea that someone who looks human, can be a rusted dead machine inside and you can never say whos who judging from their appearance. Or the forsaken soldiers who sacrifice their lives in a pointless war, which was forgotten by the governments who started it. Blood is cheaper than raw materials - this is also reflecting the main principles of our life today.<br /><br />In my opinion you mustnt have one million explosions or world-famous stars in a movie to make it good.

Dick short story which I have subsequently read; and I agree with other reviewers that the movie is true to the story for the most part.<br /><br />Have yet to view a movie based on a Dick story that wasnt enjoyable, e.g., Blade Runner, Minority Report. If you liked either of those movies,you will enjoy this movie for its intelligent entertainment.<br /><br />Wellers character Hendricksson is fairly straight forward as a disenchanted commander believing that his command has been abandoned and that their battles on this outpost planet have been made irrelevant by the higher authorities. Consequently, Hendricksson sets out to bring a truce proposal to the enemy forces.<br /><br />But technology gone awry rears its ugly head in the form of self-manufacturing killing devices known as the screamers named for their high pitched sound just before they slice and dice humans.|0.481105122727|0.196520039783|0.518894877273
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114367/|Screamers (1995)|Under rated, scary, yes, even creepy. I LIKE IT! I rented the DVD years ago, and look to buy it for my collection... to put next to my soldier and starship troopers dvds, no less. Petter Weller carried the movie. No doubt about it. The whiny, phsycologically scarred soldier from the NEBs was far better tolerated than Mr Game over man! from Aliens (bill paxton at his unusual worst). This movie deserved a better budget, but was well made within what they had. Yes, I see the static back drops... a far cry from the dynamic CG animated ones we have grown used to in recent films. However, the Outer Limits style of cinematogrophy worked well for me. Okay, everyone just getting up and dusting themselves off after launching a mini-nuke into their kid-infested base was unrealistic and could have been portrayed better. The David screamer caught me off guard from the beginning, I didnt suspect anything until he was shot. And the chick? classic move. The teady bear at the end was UBER CREEPY... and begs for a WELL DONE sequel... with Peter Weller... or else dont even try. Mark this as one of my favorite unsung movies.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114367/|Screamers (1995)|Based on a Phillip K. Dick story (the writer of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, which was the background for Blade Runner) this movie delivers, but suffers because of the apparently tight budget. Some scenes in here reminded me of the original Star Trek episodes, where the production crew had to become quite inventive to get effects on an almost non-existing budget.<br /><br />So movies low on money have to rely on their scripts and on good actors, and Screamers has them both. The story and its subplots could serve for three movies and especially Peter Weller showed a superb performance here. Generally there are some weaknesses, but they can be forgiven, if you allow yourself to get into the story.<br /><br />If you have enough of FX loaded movies that cover their thin plot with a multitude of explosions, then give it a try.|0.532512681411|0.100477263599|0.467487318589
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114367/|Screamers (1995)|Screamers impressed the heck out of me. Reviews Id read of it called it a slasher movie and said that it was highly derivative of other movies, such as Aliens and Blade Runner.<br /><br />In fact, I found it to be highly imaginative and original, very much in the spirit of the Philip K. Dick story that inspired it, pondering the ultimate meanings of humanity, war and technology. The scenery and story surrounding the film were both intriguing: despite the films low budget, the director did an excellent job of constructing the devastated planet. Peter Weller and Jennifer Rubin turned in excellent performances, and the supporting cast was also quite good. Finally, every scene is shot with a real urgency to it; particularly well done are the nightmarish confrontation 2/3 of the way through the movie and the poignant and shattering ending. In short, this is a very very good movie and well worth renting. It will stay with you for quite a while.<br /><br />Before signing off, I should say something about construing one science fiction movie as a ripoff of others. Screamers had elements of its plot which can be found in other films (ie men and machines, monsters) but it blends them seamlessly into its own original story. The mere presence of identifiable elements from other films has given people ground to criticize this movie as unoriginal. By their standards, I dont think it would be possible at all to make new movies or novels or anything. These surface similarities will always be there. One can argue that the Matrix is merely an update of Socrates cave allegory. In conclusion: ignore the critics and see Screamers!!|0.0994506102351|0.142777790519|0.900549389765
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114367/|Screamers (1995)|OK this film has virtually no budget for a sci-fi movie and no real stars to speak of other than Peter Robocop Weller but that doesnt matter because what it does have is a good story well told. Its a shame that bigger budget sci-fi productions never seem to remember that sci-fi should be have an interesting premise and not just throw a few explosions at the screen every few minutes.<br /><br />What is on offer in Screamers is a solidly entertaining 1hr 40mins of sci fi fun, reasonable acting and a great story based on a Phillip K Dick short. The main idea of screamers is a very scary one a war that had been taken over by machines that fight on our behalf a war that cant be stopped.<br /><br />For sci-fi fans this is a must see, for everyone else its still solidly entertaining 7/10|0.645294881272|0.187091503272|0.354705118728

They are in good company though. When the second Blues Brothers came out the Spice Girls movie was also in theaters. I was amazed to see how many reviewers panned the Blues Brothers and gave half-decent reviews to the Spice Girls dreadful exercise in film making. The Blues Brothers is all about the Blues and I feel sad for those reviewers who cant appreciate the quality of the music and musicians showcased in this excellent and entertaining movie. There are so many goose-bump inspiring vocal and instrumental performances by some of North Americas most legendary musicians. The dancing is good too. The car crash is fun. There are some great lines. I think there is a serious side to this movie though and it is summed up neatly in Elwoods inspirational speech when he reminds his rebellious band members what society will be left with if real musicians give up making music. I think that if you read a review by someone complaining about the plot you should quit reading right away because that person, who probably never ventures beyond the top 10 in his musical tastes, obviously missed the whole point of this movie.|0.286450507263|0.141630683519|0.713549492737

Whats next The Blues Brothers Country Club ? What has the kid to do with anything anyway ? These were some of the thoughts that seared my mind as I watched this Kluge of a movie. And like buggy software, every time you thought it was finally working, it froze up on itself. The music, which was the hit of the original flick, seems stale, even trite in this one. The car chases and crashes look like the out takes from the 1980 version. What humor there is is almost Disney like cutesy instead of funky and brash. Where was the kids skate board and puppy ? Who were they afraid of offending ? To whom were they pandering ? Guess.<br /><br />This movie was made for the advertisers who product placement seemed to be the only real concern of the moviemakers. We never expected a plot, but Gad !, would someone get a fresh set of monkeys at the dialoge typewriter, please ! All the shortcomings of the original flick were duplicated like from rote. The only message in this movie was, when youre big enough you dont have to care anymore. Just flip out some left overs, and some scraps, the adoring masses will tremble in gratitude. This movie is an unintenitional self parody, a seemingly endless grinding and rebooting of a failed concept. Its a serious downer in almost every respect.

There are so many of the newer (and older) generation who never saw the original, much less understand the influence that the musical artists involved in the music of the Blues Brothers, had on the music of today. I recently watched Blues Brothers 2000 with some young people who didnt have a clue, and seeing things through their fresh eyes, made this movie very exciting. Immediately after, they were on the Internet looking up various musical artists from the movie so that they could get to know the music that they now loved, but had missed out on.

Whenever I feel a twinge of nostalgia, I no longer have to drive down to Memphis; I just drop in this DVD -- and smile.<br /><br />Its obvious to me that the cast of this movie was on a mission from God to leave a legacy to those who come after and have never known the real thing.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118747/|Blues Brothers 2000 (1998)|I love the first film. The second - well, as we all know, we dont have John Belushi with us anymore, which is one strike right there. The filmmakers made the good choices of John Goodman and Joe Morton as backup singers. Had they stopped there, the film would have been much better.<br /><br />Instead, a kid was thrown into the mix. An orphan, of course. Awwww. Elwood Blues is supposed to act as mentor for the kid (Buster), but forgets to return Buster to the orphanage, getting half the cops in the country and several mean orphanage workers on his tail.<br /><br />Now, the whole point of the first Blues Brothers film is that these guys cant stay out of trouble. The character of Elwood, with or without Brother Jake, is going to get himself in it up to his eyeballs. The whole story about Elwood being chased for kidnapping is ludicrous. Elwood is going to get in trouble for one thing or another. It didnt have to be kidnapping.<br /><br />Thus, we end up listening to a prepubescent kid squalling the lines of a damned good song, one that was belted out by three fine singers (Aykroyd, Goodman, and Morton), thus ruining the whole effect. Its no wonder that the Blues Brothers lost the Battle of the Bands - Id have booed them offstage for bringing a kid into the mix.<br /><br />Theres an cloying, arent-we-cute gushiness about Buster and his little Blues Brothers outfit that almost gags me. I loved the musical numbers and all the guest artists - and what an impressive group they are! - so I cant understand why the filmmakers would drag down the storyline by introducing a kid, and throwing in all the clichés associated with a small child interacting with adults. The kid is precocious. Hes (supposedly, though I see no evidence of it) a good singer. He gives a pep talk at the crucial time. Hes easy to bond with. It just doesnt work.<br /><br />I will watch it for the music and for Elwoods highly inventive method of parallel parking, but I fast-forward through Busters scenes.|0.563505022693|0.179291852881|0.436494977307

When I was a kid, I used to get my dad to rent it every single week (in the days before you could buy it). Id watch the car chases over and over again, and to this day can recite whole reams of dialogue. BB 2000, I thought, cant be as good, but it must be worth seeing.<br /><br />How wrong I was.<br /><br />I have tried, but I regret to say that I can find no redeeming features for this movie whatsoever. Not one. The dialogue which once was cool and sharp is stilted, forced, wholly unrecognisable as everyday English. The addition of the little kid and the black forgotten brother was pointless pandering to political correctness and family appeal. The car chases were overblown without being entertaining, and the plot was sadly not even laughable. I only kept watching after the first five minutes in the hope of one solitary laugh to give me something positive to write about. No chance. Even the usually excellent John Goodman was well below par, and this is to say nothing of the washed up Ackroyd.<br /><br />Terribly photographed, crippled by being utterly devoid of plot, jokes, charisma and with even the music shoehorned in with no thought to aesthetics or taste, I can honestly say that BB2K ranks alongside root canal work as the least pleasant way one could ever spend time.

They hated this sequel to The Blues Brothers, but I enjoyed it very much. They need to chill a bit and realize the purpose of this film: simply a tribute to the music.<br /><br />How could any fan of blues, not like this? I mean, look at all the great performers in this film and how much better does it get to have all of them join in for a couple of jam sessions at the end? The movie sports a Whos Who of modern-day blues musicians and singers and also is directed by John Landis, who has directed some of the most entertaining films of the last 25 years.<br /><br />Plus, it was simply a funny movie with two funny guys - Dan Akyroyd and John Goodman - and a really neat-looking little kid in J. Evan Bonifant who really makes me laugh. Just looking at this 10-year-old dancing is his Blues Brothers outfit alone is worth a number of laughs. Some of the characters in here are so outrageous they would be tough to describe. The car chases, the dances and clothing and over-the-top story all add up to two hours of lamed-brained fun. No, this isnt Shakespeare and it wasnt mean to be. Its a much nicer-edged movie than the first Blues Brothers, too.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120122/|Shooting Fish (1997)|This film has a promising First Act.<br /><br />After around 20 minutes, you begin to suspect that things will go wrong.<br /><br />Then they get much worse than that, they get terrible.<br /><br />The Third Act is in slow-motion, with nine too many plot twists and no pace at all. By this time you are clawing the stuffing out of your couch.<br /><br />I hate these people for having wasted a night out of my life.<br /><br />Dan Futterman, a kind of low-rent baby Richard Gere, plays the American the English love to hate - smug, glib, an updated version of over-paid, over-sexed and over here. <br /><br />Stuart Townsend plays a shambling English wonk, good hearted and socially undeveloped. Hey, theres something new in films! <br /><br />Kate Beckinsales charm is unable to salvage the proceedings, and she projects none of the intelligence one would hope to find in a budding doctor. Totally implausible. And there are some very good character actors who are completely wasted in unrewarding roles.<br /><br />I suspect the script was written using one of those screen writing software programs, as the characters, twists and paradoxes are all arbitrary, every single last blinking one of them. Including the blow-up dolls.<br /><br />If the Surgeon Generals Office could place a Health Warning on this film, the world would be a safer place.<br /><br />I cant imagine where the positive reviews for this film originate - probably in a misplaced sense of charity.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120122/|Shooting Fish (1997)|Call me hopelessly sentimental but I actually find this film very touching! Once you totally suspend your disbelief (this is a film, its kind of expected...) Jez and Dylan really sell the orphans concept. Here you have two lonely, needy, love-starved guys who through hard work, self-denial and sheer determination win themselves a family and a home. How can your heart not melt? The acting by the male leads is strong enough (mostly - the why do I have to get so technical? scene falters a bit) to make you invest emotionally in Dylan and Jez quest despite the fact that - all soft-heartedness aside - they are two lying, selfish, close to morally bankrupt con-merchants. By the end of the film youll be cheering them on.<br /><br />What am I saying? By five minutes in youll be cheering them on! Yes, its full of clichés. Yes, its pretty predictable. Yes, its soppy. But this film proves that you can get away with anything if you have lovable characters and a fantastic soundtrack (see also Oceans 11).

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120122/|Shooting Fish (1997)|I think I have to stop watching English movies. Apart from the James Bond-movies and a small number of comedies, they are usually pure crap. This movie is definitely one of those. The first ten minutes starts out OK, and the movie has potential at this time. Sadly, it doesnt continue in this style at all. The story is about two swindlers who tries to earn a lot of money by tricking people in different ways. None of the ways they do this are funny at all. Its supposed to be a comedy, but personally I didnt laugh one single time during the movie. In addition, the story really sucks, especially because they threw a bit of romance on top of it. Alos, the ending is very bad, and it was just what I had expected because movies like this leave you with no surprises.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120122/|Shooting Fish (1997)|A comedy before its time - its all about sustainable resources! This is a brave little film, having neither big names nor obvious genre. The three principals are the latterday highwaymen Dylan and Jez, pulling scams on individuals and corporations alike to make a living. Their plans are big - they need a vast sum in order to move from their (ivory) tower to townhouse and hire - in typically unconventional fashion - a secretary to help them organise their income. Kate Beckinsdales Georgie is far too lovely a PA to allow things to continue between the friends as smoothly as it had and soon they are on the back foot with only the fresh object of their contention to bail them out.<br /><br />Stuart Townsend and Dan Futterman (especially the latter) are good value and engage with the nuttiness of their ruses to the extent that you just go along with it all. I like Beckinsdale in this - acting fresh fair and occasionally feisty is nothing to be ashamed-and-run-off-to-Hollywood about.

Theres this ad in it for a movie called Shooting Fish with Kate Beckinsale in it (I love Kate Beckinsale... well did in the other two movies Id seen her in before)with a soundtrack thats got music from Dubstar and Space and The Supernaturals and... Dionne Warwick. So anyway to make a long story short, I searched (in vain) for the soundtrack for nigh on a year but to no avail. Anyway, then one day I was at the video store (Major Video, before Blockbuster decided to buy that too) and I saw it and thought Jaysis, theres something I need to see! It had that snazzy-looking retro box, too, and I was in a happy mood, so I gladly went home and popped it in.<br /><br />This must have been the cheeriest movie Id seen in years. It made me think of Bringing Up Baby it was so happy (and thats a good thing, by the way). Kate Beckinsale is absolutely charming, the American guy is lots of fun, and the English guy has the great sense to be charming AND insanely cute in that odd way that the British have. The movie has a plot, sure, but it doesnt matter. You should just watch it and be hap-hap-happy! Revel in the retro-kitsch set design and the goofy dialogue and that English guys striped t-shirt. Its the best pick-me-up since Bounty (or, you know, whatever).

Together they engage in shooting fish, or fleecing rich people of their extra cash, in order to buy themselves the lavish house theyve each coveted because of their simple upbringing.

Its Benicios performance that hooked me in, its quirky with a feel of spontaneity . Even Alicia gets in on the act joining Benicios playfulness. And to top it all off, add Christopher Walken and youve got an interesting level of performances.|0.262753346278|0.490771547962|0.737246653722
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119086/|Excess Baggage (1997)|You know, it never ceases to amaze me how movies can be totally blacklisted by the critics to the point of it being absolutely ridiculous and unfair: Excess Baggage was victim to this. It was a bomb, however I feel it was really taken the wrong way.<br /><br />Silverstone plays a very cute spoiled rich girl who just wants some attention from her father, so she fakes a kidnapping, then locks herself in her own car. Del Toro plays an accomplished and stylish car thief... well, I think you can figure out what happens next.<br /><br />My thoughts of the film are this - Im a sucker for cute comedys with adventurous story lines, and thats what this is. The acting isnt bad, Silverstone is believable and Del Toro is always great. The chemistry on screen is just fantastic. Accompinied by a good soundtrack, and a sexy Silverstone romancing cool Benicio really makes this movie a cant miss. Even if its something to watch with a girlfriend or boyfriend. Its one of those films from the 90s that just makes you want to go back. If you are reading this and deciding to make it a date movie, it has everything a good date movie has.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119086/|Excess Baggage (1997)|One of the more enjoyable fun films Ive seen in a while, Excess Baggage left me with a smile on my face. Del Toro seemed a little uncomfortable on screen, and its always hard to see Harry Connick, Jr. trying to play a bad guy, but Silverstone was wonderfully bratty without overdoing it and Christopher Walken served up yet another delightful performance as the problem solver.<br /><br />The scene in the garage/warehouse with all of the exotic stolen cars, the bad guys, and good ol Ray (Walken) with a gun was simply priceless.<br /><br />Dont look for anything heavy here. Just kick back, relax, and have some fun, and enjoy the film for what it is.|0.199309241001|0.165196165793|0.800690758999
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119086/|Excess Baggage (1997)|How many bad reviews have I read of this movie? Way too many... I decided to see it anyway since Im one of Alicias biggest fans. By the way, if you listen carefully to all of the dialogue in this film, you will probably notice that this is her most personal film to date. I wont go into all the details, but there are a few reasons I know of why she rewrote a large chunk of the dialogue. First, the plot is original, as far as I know of. The first fifteen minutes immediately kicks into overdrive with everything happening at once. The soundtrack, too...love it. She picked that out herself, too, and made great choices. Benicio steals the show once again, but Alicia and Christopher arent far behind with their performances. Oh, and Mr. Walken is a little spooky in this movie (as expected?), but dont think of him like that in real life. Emily T. Hope is by far Ms. Silverstones most magnificent creation to date, topping Cher Horowitz and Darien Forrester. Emily is nothing like Alicia, and thats a huge sign shes the greatest actress on the market today. I suggest you watch this film just to learn a little bit here and there, despite the slowdown in plot during the middle and Brambillas lackluster action sequences. Well, except for the only car chase in the film...a classic. So, how bout a part two?|0.500689249423|0.146560846638|0.499310750577

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119086/|Excess Baggage (1997)|... or should it be Thelma and Lewis?!?<br /><br />Basically this movie is mindless fun - something that may have you chuckling once or twice and rolling your eyes a few times, as well.... Nobody is on their best behavior in this light and slightly campy film. Youve all read the plot summary - Rich brat kidnaps herself but gets more than she bargained for when her car is stolen from the garage and romance ensues.<br /><br />The cast is very good in all their places.... Silverstone plays a spoiled rich brat that wants desperately - DESPERATELY - for her fathers love and attention. But daddy is too busy with his business life and dealings - some of which are not on the most up and up... While hes no Mafia Don, its hinted that hes not the cleanest business man in the world.... Walken is daddys enforcer, who seems to help in some of the shadier deals that daddy makes. But, Walken has a decent relationship with Silverstone, and seems to be more fatherly in his relations with her...<br /><br />Del Toro plays a high end car thief who steals beautiful machines on order.... You want a Ferarri? OK, well get you a Ferarri...! Del Toro is a bit annoying with his slow dialect and dumb founded look. Harry Connick Jr. plays Del Toros agent in the car rip off ring. He does a great job in this role, that I think is one of his first.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is fun.... sure, its not the greatest comedy (romantic or otherwise) on the face of the planet, but its decent fare - a decent way to burn a few hours.... If youre a Sliverstone fan, youll probably like this one.... If youre a Del Toro fan - well, hes just himself - with a bad speech pattern. Walken is his typical bad guy self, and shines.<br /><br />Overall, Id give it a B....|0.363944353198|0.144880311176|0.636055646802

Before this movie I never cared for Alicia Silverstone, but after this I appreciate her a lot more...especially now that I know she created it. This also was the first film I saw Benicio del Torro in...and I think he is fabulous! His quirky behavior...and the comedy added in...made the film fun to see. Throwing in Christopher Walken as Emilys uncle and Harry Connick Jr. as Vincents friend helped spice up the story. I liked the story of a spoiled rich girl faking her own kidnapping to only end up with a very experienced car thief...and having them fall in love...its sweet and funny!|0.292062018689|0.388546440137|0.707937981311
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119086/|Excess Baggage (1997)|Okay, so its kind of a stock movie story with stock characters but what really makes it a view-more-than-once flick are the characters, especially Benicio Del Torro who puts in another stellar performance. Del Torros character, Vincent, was the only non-stock character in the film and Im convinced that Del Torro made Vincent all that he was -- no matter how good the writing & directing. I never get tired of Christopher Walken and his Christopher-Walkenisms so I found him bonus in the flick. And who is this superb gangster Nicholas Turturro (Stick)? Again, a so totally stereotypical character, but Turturros seamless, peerless delivery made me perk up in anticipation of how he would deliver his next line every time he showed up in a scene.<br /><br />Something else I loved about this film were the tight images. I think the quality of the air in coastal Washington(?) gave the film a solid, high resolution look. But things like the car storage facilities not being your ordinary chop shop garages contributed to that tight imaging. Even having the cars covered in plastic was a tight consideration. As much as Im not a big Alicia Silverstone fan, her face extrapolated this tightness.<br /><br />A serious detriment to the movie was the terrible weakness & implausibility of everything to do with the police -- their acting, their entire investigation activities, the chase scene, their placid acceptance of Uncle Ray at the final abduction site. So strike that stuff from your memory and focus on Del Torros acting. Thankfully, the cops dont impinge much on the story.<br /><br />Overall, I found this to be a very enjoyable film that I will *definitely* watch again.|0.607695803573|0.0833337246281|0.392304196427
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119086/|Excess Baggage (1997)|Okay, so people might think Im crazy for voting this 10 out of 10. The usual response and comment everywhere I look seems to be a negative one. But I was sitting here the other night, we just moved into a new house. I love the new environment, and I was ready for the new year. I was up late, as always, and this movie came on TBS. I had just watched Clueless with Alicia in, and I thought if I could stay awake long enough, I would watch this. I love Walken and Silverstone, but had never seen Toro in much. So I started watching it. I thought at first it was funny, hilarious, and enthralling. The way the girl tied herself up and put herself in the trunk, and was extorting her dad for money. I first thought she really wanted the money. Then I figured out it didnt matter, she wanted attention. It was a cry for help. Then I see sexy del Toro steal the car and freak out when he opened the trunk and saw her in there. The scene where Uncle Ray (Walken) saw she framed her fire news article...was hilarious and brilliant. And the scene at Knotty Pines where she said you dont have to be drunk to kiss me...and he said Im not drunk...absolutely brilliant. Not too much love scene, then the scene the next morning by the lake was touching. I loved it whenever hes talking to her dad, and he says, Are you telling me Ive only known this girl two days and already I care more about her than you do? Wonderful. And the scene at the end of the movie...I TOTALLY knew he was in the trunk. And theyre sitting there in the trunk and he says what a view..she says What makes it a view? he says You and then Dave Matthews starts playing Crash Into Me...perfect song, then he goes to kiss her and he does that come on, come on, come on, come on, come on thing...and they close the trunk. Perfect ending. Okay, so I loved the movie. I think thats clear. But if any person watched this and hated it, they need to go back and watch it again without thinking too hard about it. You wont hate it then!|0.481970485643|0.135473521082|0.518029514357

I wasnt going to sit through the whole thing but I decided to, since I really had nothing else to do, but Im glad I did. Its pretty different, to say the least. But it left me feeling happy and satisfied.<br /><br />Silverstones acting, in my opinion, is mediocre. Ive never been a big fan of hers. I dont know what it is about her, she just rubs me the wrong way. Del Toro, however, aces it, as per usual. (I love his dark, brooding eyes and the way he mumbles.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119086/|Excess Baggage (1997)|This is, without a doubt, one of the two worst movies Ive ever seen (at least movies that were supposed to be good).<br /><br />Alicia Silverstone, usually a decent actor, is simply annoying in this film. The usually excellent Benicio del Toro turns in an embarassingly bad turn as the love interest/kidnapper. In fact, the only actor of any importance here who performs reasonably well is Christopher Walken (who is the lone bright point in this complete waste of space.)<br /><br />The plot is convoluted, flighty, and downright dumb. The audience has no empathy whatsoever with any of the characters, especially with Silverstones, nor is she even a cool bad guy. In the end (indeed, 10 minutes into the film) not only do we not care at all what happens to her, but we rather wish Walken would just lose his cool, lock her and del Toro in a closet someplace, and dance away into the sunset to a Fatboy Slim song.<br /><br />Thank god del Toro got his role in Traffic, because this quite easily could have wrecked his career. I dont recommend anyone see this film, unless you are just begging for ways to waste your money and torture yourself.<br /><br />|0.633277740516|0.112962963686|0.366722259484

I wanted to watch this movie, part because I enjoyed the easy going humor in Clueless, and part because I like Alicia Silverstone as a young actress. But neither of these two reasons were enough to make me like Excess Baggage at all. The movie lacks a good plot, and is rather boring after a while.

He has proved himself in serious roles already, but I think he can be a very refreshing lead in romantic roles. Havent we seen enough Hugh Grant movies yet? I wont go into details about the plot,which had an interesting start but looked like it wasnt sure where it was headed at the end.Then again, a movie starring Alicia Silverstone cant be expected to be so plot-conscious...If youre a fan of Benicio, youll enjoy his unique debonaire charm in this movie.For once, he doesnt look that intense or sad, and we can really feel the tenderness behind his half-smile...I might not be such an objective viewer, but this movie is such a nice distraction from the Julia Roberts, Sandra Bullock romantic comedies...|0.802859793396|0.109403559415|0.197140206604

Having pretty much gotten all they could from the creature from the deep franchise the producers were left with no other choice than to attach a gimmick to this movie to draw an audience. <br /><br /> All I can remember about seeing Jaws 3-D in the theaters was that I had a lot fun. Being young I didnt care much for plot or characters. All that mattered was that I was entertained and I was. I just saw the movie recently on tape and it was all I could do to stay awake. It was just a ripoff of the original and all its clones.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085750/|Jaws 3-D (1983)|Jaws 3-D is a trashy second sequel to Jaws thats more likely to turn viewers stomachs over rather than keep them on the edge of their seat. <br /><br />The premise sees biologists Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong capturing a great white shark to hold at Floridas Seaworld. However, the manager (Louis Gosset Jr.) makes a careless decision and the shark dies. Within hours, the sharks mammoth-sized mother has arrived on the scene for bloodthristy revenge. <br /><br />Dan, on the previous page, clearly stated the mystery of Carl Gottleib, co-writer of Jaws and Jaws II, coming up with this idea. Actually, it probably seemed a good idea at the time which explains the presence of such established stars like Quaid and Gosset Jr. But, it turned out to be a thumbs-down. The film is daft and unexciting and relies more on blood and guts coming out of the screen than on suspense. The shark is bigger but no match for the two that took residence at Amity, it looks fake, roars and swims (or rather crawls) at a snails-pace and misses out on most of its potential-victims due to its clumsiness. But, of course, its just a model and so the direction is really to blame. <br /><br />Fortuanately, its quite fast-paced so watching it doesnt really do any harm.

Basically there is some underwater sea life park and some folks go down to check it out in a little orange diving machine. Unbelievable!

They could even be compared to the might of the Doctor Who films made in the sixties, with flying saucers on strings etc. Oh sorry, I forgot - they werent actually made from yogurt pots.<br /><br />You can probably figure out that I dislike this movie a lot, and youd be right. But please, take note from this review - when Carl Gottleib put pen to toilet paper we thought wed have on OK movie. It turns out that looking at a dog turd for 90 minutes would give you more adrenaline rushes than this total tosh.|0.869416548541|0.100975551956|0.130583451459

This third installment finds a great white shark who wreaks havoc at a aquatic Florida amusement park. This Jaws features some great scenes that are very thrilling and chilling the music is great and the setting of this Jaws film is what makes it so good. The acting is at the very top of the scale with Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong let me also mention Lea Thompson all three at this time were very young making this work their earliest roles. As always Louis Gossett Jr. is great.

When it attacks a underwater tunnel, with many civilians trapped inside, its up to Dennis Quaid and crew to weld a plate in place of the breach . Simon MacCorkindale portrays a Brit photographer who likes the media spotlight, but courageously offers to be live bait(..and is in the films best sequence as the shark chows down on him with the camera recording this inside the mouth, really a remarkable effect)as a distraction for Quaid to complete the welding task without harm. Bess Armstrong is Quaids lady love who decides to go down and watch his back just in case the shark swims toward them. Louis Gossett Jr. is the head honcho of the theme park who watches in horror as his dream goes up in smoke thanks to the sharks desire to feed.<br /><br />The 3D effects just arent very good..they mightve worked in 1983 on the big screen, but just make the viewing experience now a burden. The 3D effects look like just that..separate from everything else. What hurts even more is that nothing really happens for nearly 1 hour and a half until the shark makes its attack on people in the water(mainly Lea Thompson, the love interest of Dennis Quaids brother John Putch). The shark effects range from good to awful..especially rotten is the scene where the shark breaks through the glass housing the control room with Gossett Jr and company. The cast, except Bess, are merely going through the motions and its quite easy to see that the franchise was about finished off..JAWS:THE REVENGE would be the death nail on the coffin of the Jaws franchise.|0.401116243396|0.752780530222|0.598883756604

The story is idiotic, the acting is unbelievably bad and the special effects look like a 7 year-old made them on a PC. For example, at one point the shark, which looks like a cardboard cut-out (and probably is!), smashes the plate glass to the viewing area as Sea World and then, as the water rushes through the broken panel, the shark just sits there! All in all, a hilarious movie. I wouldnt have believed that it was possible for anyone to make such a bad movie in this day and age. What amazes me is why Dennis Quaid consented to be in this travesty since he is not that bad of an actor. But I guess to be consistent with the rest of the film, he acted horribly himself.

Unintentional humor being the requisite hallmark of any good B-movie, this film has plenty of it. Dialogue and acting that borders on the truly comedic, ill-defined meandering characters, loads of unexplained shots, scenes, and material-this is not the best B-movie I have seen, but it is entertaining nonetheless. The effects are perhaps the most overtly amateurish aspect of the film, and sure to get the biggest laughs (especially the end). But a discerning viewer will find more humor in the dialogue and acting (read: Gosset Jr.), vague characters (read: the British/Australian/Whatever shark killers/photographers), and terribly edited action.

When the film hit the video shelves, they scrapped the whole thing. Why make a 3-D movie in the first place if youre not going to take advantage of it when its available for the home video market? The video looked bad when it was released as a rental. Many of the scenes that were shot didnt make any sense or were badly projected. The movie did poorly at the box office and after a couple of years, no more mainstream films were presented in 3-D. The movie itself is pretty bad. Only for die hard fans of the JAWS series.<br /><br />Not recommended, unless they re-release it in 3-D. other than that its pretty much worthless.|0.787162512228|0.147839513317|0.212837487772

You dont get any better than this, and I must say, the acting, the score, and the development, all written with intellect! I do not care what any one says, this film is a true piece of work. With the same type of opening, of a P.O.V. shot in the deep blue ocean, which was missed in Jaws 2, this one has a creepy feeling from the beginning. Admittingly, the first two films preceeding this have it beat in many areas, but not all! The very idea of not one, but TWO sharks in Sea World as its grand opening takes place...is just freaky! Special effects will suffer when viewed with out 3-D glasses, however, the film is still enjoyable to watch. Alan Parker povides the film with a new kind of shrieking score that makes the feel a little eerie as the original shark theme is put to the test, and brought to a new level of scary. What most call boring, is the intellectual discussions that the main characters speak of as they, being adults, must deal with the water crises in the most mature way they can. Different ideas of murder, explosions, and captivity are all the order of the evening as the exposition is revealed. Later, the film takes a plunge when hungry mamma is let out, and all hell breaks loose, literally. Not so much the scares, as the shocks, are what draws me to this film, and every minute is worth while. Never trust the ocean, it is always full of suprises, and in all the wrong ways. Yes, the 3rd demension is pure terror, and Jaws 3-D will not fail to serve audiences with a real bang and boom! 9/10|0.395951871961|0.165246691549|0.604048128039

This was made in the eightys a few years after the second one (not as good as the first, but pretty good), the first two were made in the seventys and the sound effects and shark effects were worse in this. The shark made in this looks like a piece of cardboard that floats through the water, they copied the original score from the first jaws film and if it wasnt for a brody descendant and the score this couldve been named something else. It looked so damn fake when the shark went through the glass at the end of this ridiculously bad film. Even Dennis quaid did a bad job in this one, if they kept Roy Schneider it would be worth watching. I only gave this a two because it was suspenseful at parts. A part that bugs me is when they say they are going to bait the shark near the end they are saying they will use a live person as bait, but at the end nobody is used and all the shark does is swim at them and through a glass window and tries eating a bunch of people. Im tired of great movies being ruined by bad sequels. Jaws 4: the revenge was worse though, its pretty far fetched how a shark would know the brody family and would be stalking them in the Caribbean (jaws 4 plot).

Other than that theres no real plot--just a bunch of teens on drugs and their various adventures. Full of hilarious one liners or lines that make you just howl with laughter. Incredible set design, lighting and directing (check out the wallpapers on various characters bedrooms). Duval is excellent (and has plenty of casual nude scenes).<br /><br />Always interesting and very well-acted by a VERY interesting cast. Not as good as Living End or Totally F**ked Up but well worth seeing. The sequence that ends the film is a laugh riot--unfortunately its not supposed to be.<br /><br />SPOILERS IN NEXT PARAGRAPH!!!!

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119809/|Nowhere (1997)|Greg Araki is quite a unique director. Not many gay directors have his edge. Like John Waters and Derek Jarmon, he throws gay stereotypes out the window with an in your face style of directing. Out of Arakis Apocolyptic Teen Trilogy, Nowhere seems to be the best. Its like a generation X Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, with its bright color sets, crazed sex, drugs and brutal violence. Did I mention, theres also a space alien? The story takes place in L.A. ... We meet a cast of assorted characters; some straight, gay or bisexual. It seems these teens are unhappy, but instead of confronting their problems they indulge in kinky sex and drugs. Besides, its the end of the world. James Duval plays Dark, a lonely bisexual teen caught up in the madness. All Dark wants is to be loved. Whether its by a guy or his permissive friend Mel, played by Rachel True. Some people complain about Arakis earlier films not having much character development. Who cares?, Nowhere is stunning and features an all star cast of celebrities behaving badly. Look for a young Heather Graham and Ryan Phillippe as a horny couple with a fetish for death.|0.250460479703|0.581271851226|0.749539520297

While they were each deviant in their own way, they all had the maturity to ultimately understand each other and reconcile their differences. The characters lives in Nowhere are entirely directionless. Their thoughts, actions, and speech are never intelligent. I found it insulting that the story is supposed to represent my generation, or at least have me relate to it.

I think Greg Araki is very talented and has a complex mind in film.. and as you can see by the contents of this film, many other things.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119809/|Nowhere (1997)|Nowhere is a surrealistic piece of video-art. The story makes little sense if any and is far from real. Like everything in the movie is far from real, but rather close to an LSD-trip.<br /><br />One could say, the lack of message and meaning makes it pretentious and useless, unfortunately some actually did. They came up with different movies and meanings to compare it with, as well as theories. They wonder why the story of the movie has no direction, just as the lives of the main characters. Never considering that Nowhere, the pointless movie, was the origin and mother of all those thoughts.<br /><br />The movie lacks any kind of arrogance, and simplifies things. Of course we would expect some message. Of course we want the story to make more sense than our average life does. Nevertheless, Ive enjoyed this movie up to its fullest.<br /><br />And for those who are still deaf and are wondering when they see people dancing.... Nowhere is about the direction-less kind of life and thinking, people in general, have. They feel their choices are motivated, and logical, just as any of the characters in Nowhere. But like the story, their lives have no special meaning, no deeper context.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119809/|Nowhere (1997)|Oh, Nowhere started off with great intentions... a film trying to make a statement about the end of the world, a statement about the hatred and self-centered living of mankind. This statement was never defined because of the garbage that was presented. If I had to see one more pretty boy and his little prep girlfriend playing tonsil hockey, I would have punched by screen.<br /><br />The acting in this movie was horrible. The themes were never properly presented. The themes were never good in the first place. The characters were never given more than one dimension. I didnt give a damn about any of them. This movie attempted to be Kubrickish in presenting the horrible possibilities... but, at least Kubrick films are written and acted by members of our society that contain intelligent thought and feeling.<br /><br />Yes, my word to you... stay clear of Nowhere... all the title does is explain where the plot goes.

Its sad to see that many people have misunderstood it, but then again, its certainly not meant for everyone. People think its thrash, just a fun flick like The Evil Dead or the Troma movies. This is actually ART made to look like thrash, because it brings the audience closer to the characters. In my opinion the movie is totally impressive, both both visually and thematically. I love the dark and apocalyptic feel to it, this definitely looks like the generation thats gonna witness the end of everything.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119809/|Nowhere (1997)|Three and a half stars may seem like a high rating for a film that on the surface is all gloss and pop music. If you can look deeper though youll see a film thats about teen angst, yearning and the tortures of growing up in an age where nothing matters. The movie follows a group of teens through one harrowing day in their lives, a day that they believe will end in apocalypse. We meet several characters and watch in amusement and sometimes horror at what happens to them. Theres a lot of weird stuff going on, like a guy in a lizard suit who zaps people into ashes with his ray gun, an Ecstasy induced game of kick the can, strange cameos by former television stars (John Ritter plays a televangelist!) and a group of punk rock psychos straight out of REPO MAN. In fact its hard not to see REPO MANS influence throughout this film, which portrays Los Angeles as an apocalyptic wasteland and its residents as drug and sex crazed loonies. Each character has a vice that eventually leads to either a downfall or an awakening and this film beautifully shows us the desperation of suicide, the depths of inner turmoil and the satisfaction of a love that is finally realized. Then, in the end, its all taken away. Araki uses amazing visuals and a beautiful pop soundtrack to convey to us his characters emotions and by the end of the film, somehow I understood everything that he was trying to say. Nowhere is a lush, erotic visual piece with strange characters and strange dialogue. Its funny, brash, shocking and deeply sexual. Sometimes his metaphors are obvious and sometimes not and while this is definitely not a movie that every one will enjoy-if you have an open mind- it deserves to be seen.|0.301137326469|0.16720203857|0.698862673531

Gregg Araki seems to do whatever it takes to prove how original his movie is, but it just ends up being stupid. One guy explodes, and when the blood settles, a giant beetle is in his place.(The beetle even talks)A guys nipple rings are torn off. James Duval is the main character, Dark (As in absence of light he points out) and he is a terrible actor. Rachael True is his girlfriend, and she talks like shes trying to create a new accent or something, and thats irratating.

The film consists of a day in life of teenagers facing everyday problems yet with a quirky depiction. I highly recommend this film, but be warned it is filled with plots and structures that people may find either downright weird or disturbing.

Its hard to date this movie. Im betting twenty or thirty years from now, it will still seem up-to-date and probably still relevant. James Duval is always good and Rachel True is just beautiful.

From the very beginning one can tell that this film is going to be a major head trip, and would likely be best watched while high on some manner of substance. Still...Im no stoner, but was able to watch and enjoy it without difficulty. The movie chronicles a typical day of the average 90s teenager, but with perspectives from all orientations and view points: lesbians, gays, bisexuals, stoners, drunks, the whole nine yards. The acting was excellent, and the plot, though difficult to see at points, was quite good. The thing that threw me was the addition of the alien that apparently only Dark can see. It seemed to simultaneously interrupt and fit the story line. Conclusion: this is easily one of my favorite indie films, and I hope I can find time to see it again.|0.467126687472|0.153730159329|0.532873312528

The colors are bold and the film is really about teenagers figuring out their place in life. The dialog is absolutely hilarious. I, myself, am a teenager and the stereotypical script really seemed to fit. Every character in this film, in my opinion, is just part of a high school stereotype that you get placed into during that age. Whether it be the awkward girl who wants to fit in, sex rampaging freaks or just some young 16 year olds trying to find a hoppin party. I wish I could find this movie on DVD. Really generation defining in my opinion. Try to not listen to the people who bash this movie saying its trash and all of that.

But this probably isnt really a goal of his, anyway. As I watched Nowhere in the theater (twice in one week) I was filled with awe that something I had always felt had been so colorfully put on celluloid: finding love is all that matters, but the world isnt designed to make that finding easy. So when Dark finds an amazingly true moment amongst the usual Araki violence, hilarity, sex and clutter (a moment to simply relax and hold the person in the bed next to him) it rings true to the heart of experience. The movie ends in the next moment with an equally true touch. So, the sooner we find love, the sooner it can find its own reason to leave us. Arakis best film.

Each character is kind one sided as we see the world through the eyes of Dark, the aptly named lead; these are not representations of all teens but only the annoying stereotypes as they relate to Darks life. so taking all that in to account this is a great movie to share with friends (and confuse the heck out of them) or to watch when youre feeling a little bored yourself.

For some, it is truly like being on acid. For those of us that have blocked out the traumatic parts of growing up, then it is understandable why you dont understand this movie. The way each issue is presented is the genius of the art: Each character and their emotional impact is presented artistically as well as dramatically.

A real-life German terrorist couldnt do better playing this role.<br /><br />You can probably tell Ive just finished watching it, the adrenaline is still pumping through my veins, my wry smile still plastered across my face. John McTiernan sure packs a punch, I can tell you that. The best thing about this film is that its just a movie. It doesnt try to be anything but a formulaic, by-the-numbers, big budget action hit and so it works spectacularly for what its trying to achieve.

The Sheriff of Nottingham was the main villain (I dont think he could ever play a good guy with his expressions but just as well because hes always perfect as a downright evil mastermind). This is basically what made Bruce Willis and rightly so, he did do some of his best acting in it. All the bad guys were pretty good, the only character that really got on my nerves was Ellis because he was just such a sleaze. I thought it was cool that the father from Family Matters (Reginald VelJohnson I think) made an appearance as a cop because he really is such a great actor yet you dont get to see him in too many pictures. This film is still exciting to watch and I definitely recommend it for this upcoming holiday season (as they play many Christmas songs throughout)!

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016/|Die Hard (1988)|One of the best action thrillers ever made, Die Hard still rocks like a thunderstorm nearly twenty years after it was first released; often copied and arguably never, ever equalled, this film introduced the set-up of the lone cop/soldier/tough guy against a team of terrorists who have taken over a secured area. Wed get airports, airplanes, ships, buses, trains and many more, all in inferior films, but in Die Hard the action is set in a skyscraper, and director John McTiernan handles the claustrophobic tension with breathtaking skill. Bruce Willis also introduced the action hero as tough but eminently, realistically woundable; by the end hes a bloody, torn, shot and beaten mess. Obviously he survives near-impossible odds, be it falling through lift shafts, jumping off of exploding roofs and such and such, but hes no invincible Schwarzenegger type, and thats what makes him more likable and its what gives the film real tension. Also, in Alan Rickman, we have the very best example of the refined European master criminal who would become a stereotype very quickly; funny, dangerous, clever and sophisticated, hes a villain you love to hate. The script is a dazzler, the action is brutal, effective and extremely exciting and the final half hour in particular cranks up the adrenaline to maximum effect.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016/|Die Hard (1988)|Im a great fan of Bruce Willis and the fifty odd films which he has starred in, but his role as John McLane in the Die Hard series would have to be on the top of my list for the best Bruce Willis movie of all time. After watching and probably enjoying the film immensely, you realize how corny, but good the film was. The first few action sequences involve the ultimate bad guy, Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman in one of his more solid performances) and are great viewing. They really do set the tone for the rest of the movie, and even for the sequels to follow. But these first few scenes are upstaged by the brilliance of Bruce Willis in his many fight scenes, usually involving gunfire, glass breaking or some kind of explosion! These scenes are enjoyable and all lead to the explosive finale, which leads to a chopper going down, the roof of a building exploding, and a man falling 70 stories to his death. Theres also plenty of comic relief in this film, with Argyle, McLanes limo driver, being oblivious to the anarchy occurring above him whilst he is in the underground car park listening to music and chatting up ladies. Officer Powell, McLanes sidekick outside of the building, also provides a few good laughs. But the two main performances of Willis and Rickman take up mos of the screen time, and rightfully so, as these two characters are brilliant to watch. The Plot line is quite good for such an action-packed film, and it doesnt ever lose any of the intensity it starts out with, if it doesnt gain any that is! All in all, this is a film I recommend for anyone who doesnt take films too seriously, or just wants a good action packed film.

I was also going to bring the James Bond franchise into the conversation but the series became a parody when Bond stopped speaking with a Scottish accent sometime in the early 70s<br /><br />DIE HARD is different to the other 80s action fests with John McLane being a fairly believable genre character . Okay he`s two dimensional but that`s got to be one dimension more than John Rambo who only exists to kill a lot of nasty commies so Americans can flock to the cinema . It`s also interesting to note that McLane`s wife is used in the plot which is slightly different from how most action films work out where the hero is normally single , but that`s probably because DIE HARD as more depth to it than many contemparies. Perhaps the biggest difference is that McLane is slightly flawed as we`re shown one scene where the hero gives the bad guys something they want , not something you`d see in a Arnie or Sly movie . I won`t mention the stunts or the tightly written set pieces or how compelling they are because everyone else has beat me to it , except to say that big explosions and gun fights often overwhelm an action movie ( Bond movies are a good example ) but here they occur from the narrative instead of someone cramming them into the script in a vain attempt to thrill the audience . <br /><br />Normally I`d have a fit that an action blockbuster is well inside the IMDB top 250 but DIE HARD does deserve to be there since it`s the best movie of its type of its era .|0.713409797309|0.183038548758|0.286590202691
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016/|Die Hard (1988)|So many things made this movie great.<br /><br />This movie made Bruce Willis immortal. He soaks up this character so well, it was him. The wise cracking cop who is entertaining because he is sarcastically funny not uttering stupid catch phrases. He is a cop who looks like a normal guy, middle age, loosing some hair with wife problems. (no faked up pretty face with shaved chest and oiled muscles). He is cool without pretending to be cool. He manages to thwart the bad guys while barefoot, man that is a great twist.<br /><br />The plot is great because it does not fall perfectly in line for the hero. He stumbles, gets stuck and survives only by last minute thinking. It has plenty of action without getting ridiculous.<br /><br />And the bad guys are great, smart sinister and well acted.<br /><br />It is one of those movies that could play every weekend and would still be watched. Is one of those top 10 movies every guy should own.<br /><br />Die hard 2 was OK but not as good as the original, I wish they would have stopped after 2.

On the boat they meet a beautiful woman (Grants character immediately falls for her) and her crippled husband Oscar. The husband (Coyote) offers Nigel the chance to sleep with his wife Mimi (Seigner)but first he must listen to his entire story regarding his relationship with Mimi. The biggest part of the movie is one big flash back were you get to see how Oscar (an unsuccessful writer) meets Mimi (a waitress/ dancer) one day in Paris. They immediately fall for each other and they develop a very passionate but perverse sexual relationship. When Oscar realizes after a while that their relationship has reached the point of no return he tries to break it up. Mimi is obsessed with Oscar and she doesnt want to leave him. Oscar endures her presence but he makes her life so miserable (humiliaton, beating,...)in the hope that she will leave him. When this doesnt work he tricks her into getting on a plain and sending her of to another destination. He continues his sweet bachelor life in Paris until one day he gets hit by a car. None of his one night stands come to visit him in the hospital and one day Mimi walks in. He immediately realizes that she is the only one that can help him and now shes in control...

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104779/|Bitter Moon (1992)|The ever underrated Polanski and one of his most underrated and overlooked films. Many have cited as possible reasons the directors difficulties with the US authorities but equally it must be said this is difficult territory. It would be convenient to consider the narrator and his wife to be a couple who simply took their sex games too far and then got their inevitable comeuppance. What we are forced to participate in here, however, is the very ebb and flow of love and lust between two people not afraid to let their passions take them to the edge and even over. The moral of this tale is not that men are evil bastards and women cruelly treated but that we all have those dominant and submissive elements within us that we can use for fun or for real. In the early stages Oscar revels in playing the humiliated one, later the tables turn and finally turn again. Everybody has been known to take a sexually orientated or humorously intended remark or game too far and can surely recognise the elements displayed here even if they are written rather larger than we are used to.

Now I understand why she was in love with him in Four Weddings and a Funeral in which she also played Fiona :-), but Polanski created a film for Peter Coyote and Emmanuelle Seigner (The Ninth Gate).<br /><br />Cyote is just about the most sleazy person you can imagine as he goes about using and abusing Seigner until she is reduced to nothing, She is willing to do anything to remain with him. Why? That is a good question and what I see as the whole point here. Why remain in a relationship where there was never any love in the first place and there is clearly no love now? Wht degrade yourself to do anything to stay together? The degradation continues when they meet Grant and Thomas on a cruise and Grant is panting to get a chance with Seigner. Who wouldnt.

Untalented American writer living the ultimate petty-bourgeois life in Paris, and who thinks hes Hemingway, falls in love at first sight with a young French woman while riding on a bus.He gives her his ticket and leaves the bus. He then looks all over for her--I thought writers write?-- and finally finds her waiting tables in a restaurant. He takes her to dinner. They fall in love. They make love. Then they begin to have kinky sex. Then she becomes a dominatrix and he becomes her willing slave. They dabble in fantasy/bestiality via a pig mask. The untalented writer begins to lose interest in her. Now he becomes a sadist and she becomes a martyred masochist. He tells her hes carrying his child. She aborts the pregnancy. He tells her lets go someplace far away. They get on a plane bound fro Martinique. He leaves the plane before it takes off and he abandons her. He then begins to live the life of a playboy--maybe if he had to work for a living hed be a better writer--and makes up for lost time. He is hit by a car. Then he is visited in the hospital by his former whipping post, she knocks him out of bed and he becomes paralyzed from the waist down. Now she becomes his sadist/nurse/wife and he becomes a martry. Id go on but I think Im making my point.<br /><br />Prententious garbage. Not a comedy, not a drama, not black comedy, certainly not tragedy, not parody. Just an insult to any intelligent movie goer.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104779/|Bitter Moon (1992)|Few critics took this film seriously when it was released, but its now steadily beginning to garner attention. Today it ranks as one of Polanskis best. <br /><br />Bitter Moon is a powerful film about love, and to view it as a sort of a soft-core titillation exercise by Polanski is to miss the point. The up-front sexuality of the film is there, not to merely provoke a cheap arousal from the viewer, but to point out how empty and hollow the couples relationship really is. Most men will empathise with the morality (or lack of) in this confused relationship between an older man obsessed with his sexual object, and her adoration for him. The haunting reality is that for so many, the lack of depth in a relationship is frightening once the sexual desire diminishes.<br /><br />9/10 - Filed with lush cinematography and romantic Parisian architecture, the films only flaw is its Hugh Grant subplot. Everything else is electric, with a warped sense of playfulness that only Polanski can deliver. Worth several viewings.<br /><br />Note: Peter Coyotes room number, 5A, is the same as Tom Cruises apartment from Eyes Wide Shut. Both films have similar themes. When Eyes Wide Shut was released, Polanski made The Ninth Gate, a film which features an Eyes Wide Shut styled ritual. Both films are similar in tone.|0.269505171309|0.190545382021|0.730494828691
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104779/|Bitter Moon (1992)|One of Polanskis best films. All players give perhaps career-best performances; certainly Hugh Grant and Kristen Scott-Thomas have never been involved in anything of greater substance (The English Patient or no. And Peter Coyote is unsurpassed: weltschmerz has never been portrayed more effectively or intelligently. It is a study of different forms of human love, contemplating the distinction between that of physical desire and attraction, against something more fundamental. Special mention should be made of the theme music which, in my opinion, is Vangelis at his best, working superlatively in the context of the sea voyage setting.<br /><br />Here is perhaps testament to the notion that the best film can attain something approaching exquisite art: in capturing mere quotidian human experience, evoking something beyond. On paper this is a movie made about an obsessive love affair in early 90s Paris as recounted by one of the protagonists to an emotionally-confused englishman on an ocean voyage. But it seems so much more than the sum of its parts; it transcends and sublimates the premise of the storyline, the experiences of the characters.|0.0780332906537|0.237767997075|0.921966709346

Director Polanski brilliantly brings us this unforgettable, jet-black and haunting story of love and desire, and the threat of pushing them to obsessive limits- you can almost hear the bells of doom ring as the setting of the ship shifts to beautiful Paris and Coyotes voice-over...<br /><br />Definitely controversial and unsettling, but its one of those occasions that you just cant resist (like Grants character does) following characters that arent necessarily instantly likable. And therein, Peter Coyote excels in an absolutely devastating performance as the failed writer! Borderlines occasionally into sensationalistic kinkiness, but always recovers... not to mention by featuring one of the best (and saddest) endings I can think of.<br /><br />9 out of 10 from Ozjeppe|0.439641906499|0.909625744309|0.560358093501
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104779/|Bitter Moon (1992)|Extremely well made, extremely well acted, extremely intense and disturbing, and extremely conscious of areas of the sexual psyche that Id never seen so honestly explored in a movie. According to Polanski, it is not love and hate which are opposite, but love and indifference. Obsessive sex gives way, at least between the two lovers of Bitter Moon, to a hatred as savage as cold-blooded murder or all-out war.<br /><br />These extremities of love and hate work themselves out in a game of power and manipulation, and it remains the only vehicle by which these two can merge with one another so as to lose both their independence and the rest of their inhibitions and illusions. In the end, they become so bound up in their mutual need that the sex itself is no longer central. They might as well be prisoners lashed forever to the same stake, learning actually to enjoy the various torments that the other is able to inflict. Freud thought similarly that all sexual love was ultimately a form of masochism--identification with a partner whom one has caused to suffer. These questions are essential as long as the blood continues to throb in us; and, whether or not we find Polanskis story credible (I do), any thinking person would recognize it as a serious attempt to define who we humans are, both as rutting mammals and as something more.|0.395721787609|0.565910878914|0.604278212391
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104779/|Bitter Moon (1992)|The film begins with the camera focused on the sea and the waves, and the music with the piano playing to good effect, then an increasingly enlarging zooming shot of a porthole. Then to the cruise liner where the four main characters are based. It is a story narrated and told by Oscar, played by Peter Coyote, who is wheelchair-bound, to Nigel, played by Hugh Grant, a man he meets on the cruise. Nigel is intrigued by an entwining and serpentine tale Oscar tells him, and so are we, and even though it starts to sound incredulous, he has to return to Oscars quarters to hear more. The tale is so engrossing because it concerns Oscars beautiful, sultry and seductive wife, Mimi, played mesmerisingly by Emmanuelle Seigner. Oscar is entranced at first with her and delves into all kinds of sexual games, then his passion for her begins to subside and he rejects her and leaves her alone on a plane. All the while Nigels wife (Kristin Scott-Thomas) is becoming disillusioned with Nigels fascination with Mimi and Oscar. I do not want to unveil anymore, just to implore you to watch this film and let it mesmerise you, like it did me.

Although there are a few funny moments, you can never be sure whether they were intentional or not. The pacing is slow but wonderfully methodical. But what really makes this picture delightful is the level of the acting of the male stars. While the female leads are a bit stiff (the films major flaw), the cynical Coyote and, especially, the charmingly shy Grant (his performance here is underrated) provide two different ways for the viewer to enter the story and their interplay is offbeat and endlessly entertaining.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120112/|She's So Lovely (1997)|Every thing about this film is wonderful, except for the violence and the dark beginning. The performances by Penn, his wife and Travolta are all wonderful. This is actually my favorite Travolta role and this was the first time that he really dug beneath that cool and cocky exterior to show himself as a real actor, displaying a wide range of emotions. But the movie of course is carried primarily by Sean Penn and Robin Wright Penn, playing two messed up lovers who are out of luck in every sense of the word. He loves her madly, while her feelings for him are difficult to understand. She seems to adore him, but then it becomes clear that she also is using him. When she is knocking at the door of the guy who abused her earlier and he starts to get nervous she asks him Arent you a tough guy? and he replies no. That whole moment was very interesting and I think it said it all.<br /><br />One interesting fact that I wasnt aware of when I watched this film is that it was originally set to be made in the 80s, with the legendary John Cassavetes directing. That made me wonder what kind of beast it could have been and I believe we would get a very different kind of movie. All praise to his son Nick though, for he is also a capable director, yet there can never be another John Cassavetes again.<br /><br />James Gandolfini plays the nasty neighbor of Eddie and Maureen, a sort of a pre-Soprano signification of the creepiness and villain potential he is capable of, which he previously displayed in True Romance. Harry Dean Stanton is delightful as always when he appears in such cameo parts. Although the second part of the film may be a slight let down after the strong first part, this movie is a definite treat for those who are sick of standard Hollywood fare and for the fans of Sean and Robin Penn and Travolta.

All of which should be appreciated by any student of film. Sean Penn gives an awesome performance as an incredibly unique character who is at once sweet and frightening made humorous by the same characteristics which are within us all. And the fury offered by John Travolta causes the audience to roll with contagious laughter. I dare not say that everyone will love this film because they certainly will not. What I am saying is that it has many admirable elements which should not be so easily dismissed. Give it a chance and see for yourself.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120112/|She's So Lovely (1997)|There are some days which you feel yourself very tired and need to be happy. Shes So Lovely is very entertaining film which makes you to feel great. First of all, it was great to see two amazing actor Sean Penn and John Travolta together (pre- The Thin Red Line). Sean Penn gave Oscar-worthy performance, Robin Wright Penn was just great, Travolta was very charismatic and great as always. Film also memorable for performances of actors like James Gandolfini, Debi Mazar and Harry Dean Stanton. It is very absurd, original and funny look to what can love to do to people? Especially these people are bad!?. I really enjoyed while watching this movie. For my idea films most funny moments were final scene, dance scene and all scenes of Sean Penn but I want to say that if youre fan of John Travolta like me, dont miss that!|0.101497323219|0.0684000000106|0.898502676781

Sean Penn is sent to jail for a number of years and when he is released he returns to his love Robin Wright Penn. She is now married to John Travolta and they have several kids. Normally this kind of family business would take months or even years to solve, but these crazy people and kids settle everything in one day. This means emotions, actions and dialog concentrated to the very essence of these peoples lives. Quite fascinating to watch and reminding of the way director Nick Cassavetes father John Cassavetes used to make movies. Sean Penn always puts his soul into his work and the other actors do a great job. This movie is great fun. Watch it!!!|0.193088217163|0.82013879509|0.806911782837
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120112/|She's So Lovely (1997)|A huge disappointment in Siskel & Eberts rating! The title does not fit the movie at all. This movie was far from a comedy; it was serious and disjointed. I was waiting with expectation for it to get humorous as described but it never did. The script provided little to no motivation for Maureen (Robin Wright) to make the choice she did. The script also failed to explain why Joey(John Travolta) was so enraged he was swearing every other word he spoke. Too much pointless swearing from all the characters. If you find watching an innocent-looking little girl swear & drink beer humorous then youll probably like the movie.<br /><br />When a Man Loves a Woman with Meg Ryan & Andy Garcia, is similar to this movie.

Unfortunately this is neither entertaining nor is it art. I am disappointed that anyone thought this movie was good. I was especially angry by the good reviews especially the thumbs up. There is nothing remotely entertaining or artistic about this film, not even those adorable kiddos. To exploit those children for the sake of a film is unforgivable.

So true love is ditching your current husband and three young children for a guy you havent seen ONCE in the last ten years?

The cinematography ranges from grunge to bland and I dont understand where the romantic comedy angle comes in. Whats so funny (or romantic) about abuse and codependency taken to sociopathic levels on all fronts?

Cassavetes work relied heavily on tortured, unlikable or unredeemable characters who can act their brains out [quite often portrayed by his wife/widow, Gena Rowlands].<br /><br />Were talking serious fare, folks ~ required viewing such as Husbands, Woman Under The Influence, The Killing of a Chinese Bookie and Gloria [the brilliant Rowlands original, not the adequate Sharon Stone remake].<br /><br />Now comes his former B-movie star & son, Nick, who dusts off papas script and enlists the type of actors who are eminently qualified to play a group of true undesirables: Sean Penn, Robin Wright Penn, James Gandolfini, Harry Dean Stanton, Debi Mazar and the newly-retalented John Travolta, who appears in the last reel.<br /><br />Even Mom [Rowlands, of course] gets a small but important role.<br /><br />And the adorable Kelsey Mulrooney, playing Penn & Penns nine-year-old daughter is terrific without stooping to precociousness.<br /><br />Is this a brutally honest film? Yep. Is it vulgar in nearly every way? Of course. Do the leading characters have any chance of redemption, moral or otherwise?

Dominique Pinon (A Jeunet regular) plays the hapless wanderer Joseph, who turns up at a rather ominous butcher shop looking for work. It is a dank, rather terrifying unspecified region of France, in a future when food is scarce and vegetarians reside below the surface like rats. What ensues is both darkly comical and touching.<br /><br />Jeunets cinematic style is striking to say the least - the camera zooms around the recesses of the apartment block and surrounding alleyways like a hyperactive insect. Characters are bursting with life, oozing charm and wit - most notably the sinister butcher, or the Frog-man.

After a nuclear war a small band of people in a town survive by trading, scrounging, and eating each other. This has some absolutely wonderful performances by an excellent cast. This is a dark black comedy, which at times is whimsical, and at other times, somewhat gruesome, and sometimes both at the same time. An outsider comes to town and finds employment doing odd jobs for a butcher. He falls in love with the butchers shy daughter. Little does he know that plans are being made for him that probably dont fit in with his intentions. This movie has so many little things that it must be watched more than once to catch them all. There is a sequence featuring a bicycle pump, knitting needles, a man and a woman in bed making love in a bed with squeaky springs, that is just incredibly entertaining. Another highlight is a depressed and suicidal woman who makes several unsuccessful attempts at doing herself in. And thats entertaining? Yeah, it is, you have to SEE it. This is a totally bizarre film, equal parts light and dark, with very likeable characters and somewhat of a good nature to it despite its subject matter. Highly recommended, and if you see this and DO like it, you will want to see City of Lost Children and Amelie, which are both by the same people, also containing some of the same actors. 10 out of 10!|0.112746849219|0.211356227283|0.887253150781

This movie is set in another universe that looks like maybe a post-apocalyptic French village. Its along the same lines as Terry Gilliams Brazil, a world in which too much has gone wrong and theres an underground group trying to right things. Its another best movie youve never heard of candidate, directed by Marc Caro and Jean- Pierre Jeunet; starring a bunch of French actors youve never heard of. (Well, Ive never heard of them.)<br /><br />Im unwilling to try to summarize the plot, I wont even try to describe it. Its a bizarre, funny movie that youll love or hate. The characters are wonderful, the situations are delicious, and the possibilities are intriguing. As I sit here remembering the movie, the scenes wash through my mind, and there is nothing I can recount here that would make any sense.<br /><br />Caro has done nothing else Ive heard of. Jeunet wrote and directed (in the American English titles) A Very Long Engagement, Amelie, and The City of Lost Children, all of which Ive seen, and Alien 4 (also known as Alien: Resurrection), which Ive seen parts of as Ive surfed the channels. Delicatessen is nothing like them, nothing like anything else youve seen.<br /><br />Ultimately its a series of more or less loosely connected skits that are fall off your chair hilarious, tied together in building with a street-level deli and people renting rooms on the five or so floors above.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101700/|Delicatessen (1991)|This is based upon the Special Edition. Ive been wanting to watch this for years, and I was not disappointed in the least. In fact, I could not take my eyes off this for a second. This takes place in the future, in a post-apocalyptic time where natural food is so difficult to come by, its used as currency. A butcher decides to take on this problem with a very hands-on solution... cannibalism. The story is well-told. Editing and cinematography is amazing, and this has some unforgettable images and sequences. The black comedy is hilarious, and hardly any joke or gag falls flat or feels forced. Characters are well-developed and interesting. Everyone is well-cast, including Pinon, who keeps getting hired, and with good reason, by Jeunet(whose efforts I continue to follow with great anticipation for every production of his that I get to view). The acting is flawless, even the kids are convincing. This has a great pace, and is not boring for a second. I dont know enough to say if the concept is completely original, but it didnt remind me of anything Ive seen or read before(I hear that at least one aspect is similar to Brazil, though). This is immensely creative and imaginative. The script contains plenty of surprises. This builds atmosphere impeccably well, and is rather exciting when it goes for that. Parts of this are rather surreal. Not speaking enough French to judge it, I can only comment on the understanding of the dialog that I got from the English subtitles; a lot of it is quite clever. There is a little strong language, a couple of hints at sexuality and several instances of disturbing content. The DVD comes with an excellent directors commentary(albeit sans Caro, since he does not care for them), two featurettes that I will review on their individual pages here on the site, a teaser, a trailer and a photo gallery.

This disappointed the people I was watching it with, so they left. This did not stop me, however, from watching and, in turn, loving this beatiful piece of cinematic masterpiece. I am a huge fan of any movie (or thing) that is off-centre, and not-quite-right. Delicatessen fits this perfectly with its distorted camera angles and equally distorted characters. Jeunet and Caro have made one of the best movies ever!|0.224051481626|0.147620573864|0.775948518374
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101700/|Delicatessen (1991)|This visually impressive and imaginative movie is probably Jeunets best. Here he and his usual team create what they do best, namely weirdness. Take Amelie, remove everything that people label so French and turn it inside out. Thats the feeling of Delicatessen.<br /><br />The plot is goofy but works very well in the movie and has so many little twists and turns it never lets go of your attention. The quirky(for lack of a better word) characters and the great dark humour is not for everyone, but if you can appreciate it then you wont be disappointed.<br /><br />The acting is good, and the various weirdos in the apartments are very convincing. A personal favourite was a guy who grows frogs and snails in his apartment. His insane look was a treat.<br /><br />If you really liked Amelie then you might also like this. That being said, they are very different while maintaining the same basic mood. Do yourself a favour, delve in the mind of Jeunet and check out this dark and twisted comedy for those with good taste...|0.138206506601|0.154747974804|0.861793493399

Everything in this movie is so fresh, and unpredictable, and new, and fantastic, and there is even a beautiful love story incorporated! :) Delicatessen differs so much from todays Hollywood movies, which all are filmed in similar fashion. I have picked this one from one of the Best off SF list, and I am glad I have watched it. I dont have much time to spend, and I tend to preselect movie on which one I will spend two hours of my time.<br /><br />European movies are so interesting and rich in comparison with US films, and I dont get how is possible that people still watch low quality stuff, when there are masterworks like this one.|0.299904995572|0.131499218055|0.700095004428
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101700/|Delicatessen (1991)|Being a big fan of Jeunets more recent films, I was happy to find this one on cable last week. I found myself chuckling through the whole thing; not just at the jokes, but at the painstaking way Jeunet and Caro plant plot, scenic, and sound details that later play important parts in the film. (They even took time for things like designing and filming one of the cleverest opening credit sequences Ive seen.) Jeunets films are a feast of color and sound, where almost every character is memorable in his/her own way.<br /><br />The plot is simple, but why complain? The directors have created an entire world for us to enjoy, filled with quirky people (the suicide woman, the guys who make animal-noisemakers...for whom?), weird set design (there must be a plumbing fetishist on the crew), and painstakingly-created set pieces (the flood, the fight on the roof, the squeaky bed).

No other movie Ive seen so far could top this one for its combination of wittiness, dark humor, love for detail and collection of regular people holding a mirror up to each and everyone of us, showing us how strange we really are.<br /><br />Indeed this movie will not be constrained by a classification as romance, comedy or science fiction or horror. It is much more than the sum of these - it is a work of art and the painstaking work and love for detail which Jeunet & Caro have put into it show everywhere you look.<br /><br />This movie is definitely off-beat and I definitely love it!|0.494079063431|0.522593536931|0.505920936569

Theres a noncomformist who eats snails and frogs, a band of grimy cave-dwelling looters, an unhinged woman whose botched suicide attempts are comic highlights and an amazing musical sequence featuring a cello, creaky bed springs, machinery, drills and other noises combining to create a symphony of sounds.<br /><br />The oppressive atmosphere and murky brown color schemes could have easily turned this into a dreary disaster, but the directors keep it offbeat, surprising and clever throughout, and dont miss their chance to throw in some inventive black comedy.|0.342538336957|0.558186251452|0.657461663043

There are some truly great set pieces in the film particularly when the whole house starts to get into the same rhythm as the love makers on the top floor ( ripped off by an American Beer company I note in an advert ) and the botched suicide attempt too - hey I said it is darkly amusing!!

But you wont really care when you see it, because even though the story isnt really elaborate, what you have here is one of the most original movies youll ever get your eyes on. The setting is perfect, with no historic or geographic references, only an estranged building, which doesnt have a single straight normal tenant. The result is a magnificent work of actors, cinematography and set dressing, that makes the most of visual resources for a movie. The directors Jeunet & Caro show their true potential in this movie that will keep you glued with its naive-like comedy style, and its unique set of characters, which could generate a separate movie about each and every one of them.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101700/|Delicatessen (1991)|Delicatessen is a very original comedy from Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who also directed the great Amélie. It tells the story of Louison (Dominique Pinon) who is the new helper of a landlord named Clapet (Jean-Claude Dreyfus). Clapet is a butcher and in a world where food is rare he prepares cannibalistic meals for the people in his building. Louison is the new meal and the people in the building wait for Clapet to kill him so they can eat. Clapets daughter Julie (Marie-Laure Dougnac) falls in love with Louison and to save him she seeks help from an underground group.<br /><br />You have read the above and you must understand Delicatessen is not a normal movie. Although its subject is close to very scary the movie is a comedy and to be honest it is very funny at times. Listen to the way people talk here. Especially the conversation between the butcher and a mailman is very funny. The underground group gets a lot of laughs as well. The movie hints at real horror images but never gives us that. Most of the time the tension is broken with something funny.<br /><br />Delicatessen is not only pretty funny, it looks terrific as well. From the great opening sequence to the last shot it is visually perfect. The production design and especially the cinematography add a lot to the movies whole atmosphere. May be it is not for everyone, some will find it ridiculous or the idea too lugubrious, may be it is, but the way the subject is handled is the right way. At least it is interesting and therefore already worth seeing.|0.242973880484|0.120549878727|0.757026119516
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101700/|Delicatessen (1991)|If Citizen Kane is the number one movie to see to learn anything about cinematography, this might as well be at number 2. <br /><br />Delicatessen succeeds at creating a totally separate, consistent and believable universe with a very distinct atmosphere. The brown and green colors add to the weirdness of this universe. <br /><br />Is it horror? Yes and no. Is it a comedy? Yes and no. Is it brilliant? Oh yes!<br /><br />Everybody involved in the making of this picture gave it its best. The camera work is brilliant, the sets are simply amazing (with the final bathroom scene at the pinnacle), the editing and pace is breathtaking.<br /><br />This could have been a very dark movie (and I guess a few Hollywood directors would have tried to turn it into a splatter movie and fail miserably), but the humor is just light, off-beat and hilarious enough to make it into a consistent and bearable whole. Every universe has its humor, and a strange universe has strange humor. Jacques Tati would have loved Delicatessen.<br /><br />Julies tea ceremony without her glasses, the mattress spring test, Aurores failing suicide contraptions, its all funny as hell. I hope everyone who is even marginally involved in making movies gets to see Delicatessen and learns from its greatness. We could sure use a touch of genius in most of them ...<br /><br />10/10|0.325208778395|0.152793247696|0.674791221605

Dantes glass is obviously half empty, while Randals is constantly being refilled. I love to see these two characters interact, no matter what theyre talking about. Smiths short film, The Flying Car, shown on The Tonight Show (a few years back) is a perfect example of the characters wonderful chemistry. <br /><br />Also, the man who played the old Jewish man (Al Berkowitz) was by far my favorite actor. I wish I could see him in some other role.<br /><br />Many have accused this film of being unnesessarily profane and disgusting, but I feel that intermittent f-bombs and terms like jizz-mopper are crucial elements of the characters identity, and quite frankly are words our society DOES use. Art imitates life, as they say. <br /><br />This is Kevin Smiths funniest and finest story. The directing/photography leaves something to be desired, but as a green filmmaker myself, I appreciate Smith sticking his neck out and doing something like this.

It will have extra appeal to anyone (like me) who has been a shop Clerk and has had to endure stupid customer questions like are you closed?! Warning, the acting can be annoying on watching it again so it is better to look at it as adding to the clerks questionable character. I have the soundtrack, mainly for the great version of Go your own way. It also makes me chuckle at the sound clips from the movie. Smiths labour of love definitely made an impression on me - it was shown on Sky movies during an independent movie slot (used to be every Sunday night I think). This movie made me pay out hard-earned cash, mainly for that slot. Also, I seen Dogma in NYC the day it was released..there was a great atmosphere, almost like a big sporting event so obviously Smiths films have done extremely well from these humble beginnings. I think Smith may have decided to make his later movies more mainstream. However, they all share an interesting slice of life, his view askew.

The story focuses on the two workers Dante Hicks (OHalloran) who works at the convienate store next to the movie rental store with Randal Graves (Anderson). Randal is a smart ass who says whats on his mind and then youve got small minded Dante who is mostly quiet and angry inside but to scared to let out his anger. While on the job they meet w shoppers and the birth of the best duos Jay (Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith). Jay is a pot head looking for two things in life, drugs and the ladies Silent Bob hardly talks at all but when he does its normally heart warming and inspirational. Too bad the movie isnt. Wait screw that who needs heart warming when you got Randal, snowballing, Randal, Jay and Silent Bob, and of course Randal.

This is the introduction to the world of Kevin Smith. Clerks is the first movie of five (the other four go in order: Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) and fixates itself around Quick Stop store clerk Dante having to go in on his day off. This proves to be one of the worst days of his life. Things start off with a cigarette revolt and dont get any better from there. I like how Kevin Smith makes the movie around one big line repeated by Dante: Im not even supposed to be here today! Its just cool to see how one persons life can be ripped to pieces when: your boss lies to you, your ex-girlfriend is getting married your best friend shows up late for work as usual, and you have to come in on your day off, among an array of other things I dont want to spoil.

Over the years I have found one constant. If you dont get it, you ARE clinically stupid. NO-ONE I have ever given this film to who likes it is stupid. I mean ALL races, ages & sexes. NOT one specific group, NOT geniuses, all types unified by the fact theyre intelligent WITH passion & have a heart, because thats what Kevin Smith gets to, your heart. The dialogue, given in moments of calm, sucks you in because of its surrealism, its ability to provoke thought, its reflection of your own experience, and then hits you with some of the most laugh out loud, wet your pants, surreal comedy moments that you just dont expect and have ever seen. You care about the characters& recognise yourself in different ones. Above all the film doesnt make many absolute judgements. A few universal truths, which if are unrecognised mean you need to stop living with mummy&daddy and grow up, but mostly a lot of differing perspectives. The judgement is left to YOU because Smith doesnt patronise you as Hollywood does, youre treated as if your intelligence is respected and present, which is as acutely as I can put it as to why you ARE a pricking moron if you dont get it. If you are the elite of people who finds because of this film you are in the minority, you will then realise how many TRULY stupid people there are in the world. Any critic who slams a Kevin Smith film, well, you can forever ignore any review they give. Pity them, they ARE stupid.

I laughed so hard at Clerks, i lost breath twice. Ive worked retail. Dante and more so Randal say almost everything that a retail clerk would want to say. They get away with it as well. Kevin Smith proved himself a genius. Raunchy humor, endless sight gags, and the best use of a small cast ive ever seen. Something to offend everyone, and thats what makes this room so great. Another thing that makes so film so great was that it spawned sequels without them being true sequels. It was a series of movies that all tied in with each other. Even having the same actors play other roles. Not something that main stream Hollywood had done. Clerks made Hollywood take notice, and for awhile, they stayed away from the cookie cutter approach to making movies. No movie as important as Clerks had been made in a great while.

I didnt really know what to expect other than it is in black and white and scripted by our beloved producer but what a hilarious film it turned out to be.<br /><br />The dialogue is typical Kevin Smith work, evident in his later films such as dogma and chasing amy, and might I add work that I thoroughly enjoy. The film was shot on a budget so dont expect anything fancy. No real big names although by now you should have heard of some of the actors.<br /><br />It will appear that this film is more appealing to Kevin Smith fans and not really for the faint hearted movie viewers who prefer clichés and typical dialogue (including them awful one liners). Oh no no no, this is one fast talking, twisted and very entertaining movie, but one that can only be appreciated when one can lower his/her inhibitions.<br /><br />Give it a shot, its something different and if its your cup of tea then you should love this movie, but if not then come back to it at a later date, you may actually appreciate this film at some point in your life!|0.397673426099|0.143733834948|0.602326573901

To make a series of movies that were connected, not as per usual with a concurrent story, but with stories that took place with people who either live in, or have lived in or around Red Bank, NJ. Clerks is the one that starts it off, and theres not really much to it: A series of dumb or annoying customers, the rudest store clerk EVER (who has the coolest no consequences approach to life) and of course poor Dante, who wasnt even supposed to be there that day. Its not for everyone, but for those that like their comedy as dark and rowdy as possible, its a sure winner and the story of how they made the movie (Jeff Anderson had for instance never acted before!) doesnt make it less impressive, and knowing the stuff they had to do (like the shudders being closed because they could only film at night, and it was supposed to be day) only makes it more funny. 9/10.|0.821606198423|0.256939667739|0.178393801577

The plot is difficult to explain as its just about two guys in a convenience store and one weird day, the script is sharp with plenty of humour but clearly has something to say no matter how muddled. Jay & Silent Bob make their first appearance here but its Randall and supporting characters that have the best lines. The best way to describe this film is a slacker comedy its perfect to watch with your mates and pizza.

Clerks. is a very simple idea of one day at a job.<br /><br />The main character is Dante Hicks, a college drop-out who gets a phone call from his boss, saying he has to work on his day off. This is just one of the many things that makes Dantes day at work more and more unbearable. His day starts off with an activist who enters the Quick Stop Convenience Store, and complains about the health problems smoking causes to the other customers, in one of the most funniest moments of the film.<br /><br />The other main character is Randal Graves, a true slacker in the sense. He likes to come to work, usually about a half hour late, order Adult movies in front of a three year old, back talk to customers, watch Star Wars and talk about the innocent people dying on the almost finished Death Star in Return of the Jedi, or lock up the video store and talk to Dante.<br /><br />The other characters, Veronica, who is Dantes girlfriend, who always bugs him about going back to college. Caitleen Bree, who is still secretly loved by Dante, even after she cheated on him 81/2 times, and who is marrying an Asian Design Major.

Its about a job the main characters hate, and do everything they can to fight the boredom of the long hours of a job, even if its playing Hockey on the roof or going to a wake.<br /><br />Clerks. is a comedy for those who appreciate good dialogue and superb characters.<br /><br />10/10.|0.372627515568|0.523204025041|0.627372484432
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109445/|Clerks (1994)|Fans of Kevin Smiths work may debate what movies of his are the best. Some say Mallrats some say Chasing Amy but I feel the majority are in the Clerks. camp. One of the most screamingly funny films of all time that speaks about a lost generation. The intelligent, under-appreciated faux scholars of the Quick Stop and RST Video are archetypes of the modern man. Dante the lost. Randal the outspoken.<br /><br />Each of us have those tendencies in us. We all, at some point, have felt lost in the modern world. Yearning for the days past. The days lost. Wishing that high school was a full time gig. For many people it was the peak of their lives. Working a dead end job. Working a job that you keep because its easy. There is no pressure and best of all no expectations. Dante Hicks is one person. Nothing special. Not especially handsome or intelligent. But he is searching for his way in life. We drop in on a day where his life changes. We drop in on his, what may very well be, his defining moments. His ex-girlfriend is getting married. His current girlfriend reveals sexual exploits that hed rather not have heard. All this and his best friend, Randal, stirring the pot.<br /><br />Randal, he supposes that he knows it all. He has it all figured out but merely its a cover for the frightened and lost boy that he is. No ambition. No future. And no strings.<br /><br />Clerks. is a modern classic that struck at a time when the age bracket didnt have a voice. We needed an outlet and Kevin Smith struck a chord in all of us.<br /><br />Ive grown with Smiths movies. I see progression throughout his films.

Even by the movies low budget standards, the acting is uniformly terrible -- Ive seen more compelling high school theater. The plot, if you can call it that, is arbitrary in the worst way.<br /><br />Couple this with over-the-top stylized cinematography that serves no aesthetic purpose, characters that show no development and come to us purely through clunky exposition, and you have the most over-rated movie of the 90s.|0.609365115192|0.138267973885|0.390634884808
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109445/|Clerks (1994)|I see I am clearly in the minority here and it wouldnt be the first time, but I just didnt find this movie all that entertaining. Maybe this movie has a cult following that I dont get.<br /><br />Firstly, the acting was atrocious. Now, that could have been the intent, but if so, I never got that impression. The dialogue was delivered so mechanical, most times it seemed like the actors were reading directly from cue cards.<br /><br />Secondly, this movie had no direction. Where was this movie going? Again, maybe I missed the intent, but was it just to capture the dull and pathetic life of a clerk and those around him? I dont expect every movie to have a mighty and life altering message, but at least have a loftier aim than go to work, have a screwed up day and go home.<br /><br />Finally, there was entirely too much profanity. It was to the degree that it had no more impact. If vulgarity is going to be used, then using it sparingly can make it funnier and have more of an impact on the script. The flagrant use of profanity in this movie just made the movie juvenile and childish.<br /><br />Overall the movie just didnt move me. I laughed very little, there was nothing to think about, and there were no magnificent or even decent performances. I did like one scene though, and that was the different take on The Return of the Jedi. I thought that was an interesting and funny take on the movie, but I also think that-that could have been done in a short film. Cut this movie down to a five minute short film about the innocent independent contractors on the Death Star and the movie is a lot better in my opinion.|0.726458089782|0.1640260631|0.273541910218
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109445/|Clerks (1994)|Kevin Smith is one of my favorite Directors, not only because he can direct, but he can create funny situations out of almost thin air. We see this in Mallrats, but this film...clerks, his first one is a bit out of the league.<br /><br />First of all the actors cant act, its a fact. None of them really convinces me. And the script sometimes focuses to much on...nothing that it almost becomes intolerable to watch. Not even the directing is that good in this movie, but I think I speak for all Smith fans when I say that we are willing to forget and forgive most of this when it comes to clerks.<br /><br />Making a movie about two guys talking crap behind the counter of a quickstop is a very original and funny idea, but Smith does not pull this of all the way. He focuses to much on duologue, duologue that you know is very rehearsed, every line is presented with the utter most perfection which makes it less believable. But not all of it is bad, as I said before the idea is very original and some of the jokes really made me laugh.<br /><br />And lets not forget that this was his first real movie and that it took him from nothing to Hollywood in like a second, now thats impressive. Its also that fact that makes this movie so good, every aspiring director (including myself) sees this movie and if it werent there before, now there is hope, hope that someday i will make it big time to. That is what makes this movie so great and thats what makes me love it.<br /><br />May the force be with you...always.

But after watching it many more times, it does dawn on a viewer that a lot of things are amiss in this movie. <br /><br />First there is the acting, where nearly ever character has at least one take (that made the final cut) where they have a noticeable pause because they either (A)forgot their line (B)got tongue tied on the dialogue Kevin Smith wrote up. <br /><br />The dialogue itself is the second major flaw in this movie. Its really hard to count this as a definite flaw when it does so much for the movie, but at the same time it is obvious that cons of the dialogue: (A)covering too much essential material too briefly (B)statements that are too long and elaborate for the given actors to do them justice (C)unrealistic detail and stream of conscious in the characters statements; out-weigh the positive aspects: (A)humorous anecdotes and tangents expressed through tirades (B)unique character interaction. <br /><br />This is not to say in any way that this movie is poor, but these attribute bring it considerably below the mark of 7.9 that IMDb voters have given it.|0.556338743349|0.187500379659|0.443661256651

The film is about a guy who works in a convenience store. He comes across the weirdest and most annoying customers that, ironically, dont shy too far from those in real life that I, myself have come across. This clerk is visited by his girlfriend and regularly visiting by his distraught and careless friend who is a clerk at the neighboring video store.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109445/|Clerks (1994)|Kevin Smith has delved into action (Mallrats), drama (Chasing Amy) and philosophy (Dogma) in his Askewniverse, but Clerks, the first film of the series, is still the best.<br /><br />Shot on a ridiculously low budget, using mostly friends and relatives as the cast and crew (see the line in the credits where Boom is credited as whoever happened to be holding the pole), Clerks is such a great film just because it doesnt try to be more than it is. You get the sense that this movie is in black and white not to be pretentious, but just because its a prosaic look at prosaic lives.<br /><br />Kevin Smiths real gift is writing funny, witty dialogue, and thats what carries this film. From Star Wars debates (did the destruction of the second Death Star in Jedi cost innocent contractors their lives?) to perfectly serious debates about sex (Thirty-seven???), this is the ultimate movie for anyone whos ever been going nowhere and doing nothing. Its a day in the life of the guy working at the corner store, no more, no less. But its absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />People either love or hate Kevin Smith movies. Chances are, if you can appreciate the humour of low-brow jokes about pornography as high art, then youll enjoy Clerks. His brand of humour isnt for everyone.

Or sticking my hand in it., while T.S. is a romantic loser who says things like  You should see yourself right now - a grown man with his hand down his pants.

Character development is a big big part of movies and this one has development of 2 memorable characters who we would see in a later film...Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. Kevin Smith excels as director (and actor as Silent Bob). This movie also launched the career of Jason Lee who played the comic loving, video game playing, mallrat of a crazy fool Brodie Bruce. Lee has gone on to star in such films in Stealing Harvard, A Guy Thing, Dogma, and Almost Famous.

If not for the preoccupation with superhero sex organs, supermans potential birth control or possible future realistic child bearing partners, then just simply for the answer to what noises do you make when youre having whoopee.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113749/|Mallrats (1995)|This is the second film by cult, independent film-maker Kevin Smith. After the success of Clerks gritty, realistic story, Kevin Smith was given a budget (still small) and more respectable actors to work with. <br /><br />Unlike his debut however, Mallrats takes a similar premise and aims squarely for the teenage comedy market. Hence a heavy dosing of slapstick and crude humour courtesy of Jay and Silent Bob amongst others. Mallrats centres around Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee) and T.S. Quint (London) as they try to win back their girlfriends at the local mall. Simple, barely original storyline. But at least it gives Smith the chance to flex his writing skills yet again.<br /><br />Jason Lee is great in his first major movie role and he easily makes the most of his dialogue. The rest of the cast are average and simply do the jobs they are intended to do. As for Jay and Silent Bob (Jason & Kevin), they yet again steal the movie simply by dropping in and out of the main story. One batman gag here, one dance scene there and the film is theirs. Playing a slightly more central role than in Clerks, these two are still great.<br /><br />Overall Mallrats is an acceptable second offering from Smith that he would later better with Chasing Amy. Watch Mallrats expecting crude, entertaining teen comedy and feel satisfied. If you feel like more afterwards, move on over to Chasing Amy and give that a whirl. Either way, Kevin Smith has continued to build his cult via Mallrats.|0.500399745187|0.440320273003|0.499600254813
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113749/|Mallrats (1995)|Kevin Smiths second feature is actually very similar to his first. Both are set over one day and feature the exploits of two friends who have little hope for the future. However whilst Clerks was a fairly realistic film, Mallrats has much in common with 1980s teen films and sometimes comes across as a teen romantic/comedy. One scene even contains a bit of gross out humour which called to mind American Pie.<br /><br />Despite this, Mallrats is a great film that is really, really funny. Kevin Smiths flair for dialogue and characters shine here. Brodie has to be one of his greatest creations and keeps the film entertaining throughout. Even the typical cheesy romance parts keep the viewer engaged because of the humour used throughout. Ben Affleck also makes a great villain - partly because I hate his other movies so much. <br /><br />I still think that this is a film for people who know films by Kevin Smith. So Clerks would be a good film to see before Mallrats. But if your a fan there is very little that can go wrong in seeing this film.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113749/|Mallrats (1995)|This is a niche film. If you can put yourself into the mindset of a 20-something slacker, who has no ambition whatsoever in life, this film may engender some sense of emotional investment in its characters and a sense of identifying with same. However, if this situation is impossible for you, then you will not only not see the humor herein, you will most likely bemoan the time wasted in its viewing.<br /><br />This is a Jay and Silent Bob flick wherein the two buds are dumped by their gals, subsequently seeking major wound-licking in the mall. It plays like the Revenge of the Nerds, though not as intelligently, nor with the same amount of heart, but with a more modern spin.<br /><br />If youve of a mind, this can be highly entertaining.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113749/|Mallrats (1995)|To render the proper justice of Mallrats genius, it should have started as a novel. As a movie, I saw it get judged and snubbed by the film buffs, but let me disagree here, take Mallrats for what it is, an entertaining portrait of consumerism counter-culture.<br /><br />Petulent formula you might say? Well think about it. Mallrats has been made in 1994 and was portraying the first generation of grown up kids put up face to face with mass capitalism. As the portrait shows kids with mixed up feelings and a sense of confusions towards this abundance, it remains fun.<br /><br />Thats what Mallrats is. Pure fun. Kids forming their identity against all the abundance of stuff pushed down their throat. Crazy situations in a mall, epic story of reconquering your true love...in a mall...are they buying stuff? No. Sometimes you almost forget the thing is in a goddamn mall.<br /><br />Ive had fun with this movie. Brodie Bruce is the prime example of the empty criticism towards his generation. Its not what you do that defines who you are, its who you are that defines what you do.<br /><br />Pure non-arrogant fun, killer dialogues and a legacy that lives on.

The story flows well and the characters are interesting and likable but I reckon that the characters of Jay and Silent Bob are the highlight of the movie. Their attempts to dismantle the stage by exploiting its weakness are genius. There is some sex type content, not very much however and its quite mild (I think) but I think it could have done without it, however thats just me I like my intercourse scenes absent and visible mammary glands blurred. If you are anything like my brother however (who is the total opposite in that area), you will enjoy these bits.

Heres why:<br /><br />The characters: Brodie (Jason Lee) is a good character, the Randal of Mallrats if you like but I found T.C highly annoying and irritating. T.c is meant to be the straight guy to Brodies wise-ass but he just angers me. All he does is whine (Thats all Dante did but...)<br /><br />The script: Clerks had a brilliant script, the dialouge was well observed and real without being meaningless. Mallrats script isnt bad but its not as clever or as well realised as clerks.<br /><br />Jay and Silent Bob: IMHO, these two characters cant carry a film on their own (JASBSB is a prime example of this). In mallrats theyre normally supporting roles are made to be more main, more involved in the story. IMO they are weak characters and Mewes acting is extemely poor.<br /><br />While this film isnt terrible, it is the 2nd worst film in the new jersey trilogy. JASBSB is the worst.|0.745770241915|0.127740893555|0.254229758085
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113749/|Mallrats (1995)|Mallrats tells the story of two friends who are dumped by their girlfriends on the same day. They seek solace at the local mall where they hang out all day doing nothing but talk about their girlfriends and comic books. They get into a series of situations that eventually leads to the two enlisting the help of slackers Jay and Silent Bob to get their girlfriends back. This is the second film in the New Jersey series by Kevin Smith. This entry is miles better than its predecessor Clerks.<br /><br />I loved how Kevin Smith did this movie. Kevin Smith is a comic book geek, so Im glad he made a movie to portray that taste. Comic book lovers will truly enjoy all the references and parodies within the film. I know I did. Thats what made the movie even more enjoyable to me. The appearance of Stan Lee was the cherry on the ice cream for me. Aside from that, this movie is just paced and styled better than Clerks was. This was non stop laughs whereas Clerks was more of a satirical black comedy. Also, a lot happened throughout the film even though it only takes place within a day and within the same mall, rather than Clerks which was slow moving and downright boring in some parts.<br /><br />I enjoyed the acting in this movie. Jason Lee is hilarious as comic book fanatic Brodie Bruce. Jay and Silent Bob have a lot more to do in this film than in Clerks, and they make some of the funniest scenes in the movie.<br /><br />Overall, Kevin Smith had his practice with Clerks, so he had the resources to make a better film, and he certainly did. If you liked Clerks, or even if you didnt, youll love Mallrats.<br /><br />8/10|0.36495197272|0.482066004214|0.63504802728
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113749/|Mallrats (1995)|Granted, its weaker than his other three films to date. On the other hand, a weak Kevin Smith movie is stronger than a strong film by most other writers/directors. This film is hilarious! It takes mall culture to a higher level! A good contrast to Richard Linklaters/Eric Bogosians Suburbia, though its better than Suburbia in most ways. Many of the pop culture refs and the satire of young adult life make this film even cooler! And how the hell did he get Stan Lee to appear? (And he was surprisingly really good!)<br /><br />This is Shannen Dohertys best role (mainly because shes hardly ever on screen;), Jason Lees best role, and Jeremy Londons best role (not to be confused with twin brother Jason who was the awesome Randall Pink Floyd in Dazed and Confused...though Ben Affleck and Joey Lauren Adams were both in Dazed as well...)<br /><br />Look for an amusing role played by Ethan Suplee (Seth in American History X)<br /><br />Overall: this film just plain rocks! Its got great quirky writing, great direction, solid acting, a three-nippled topless clairvoyant, a hilarious love connection parody, a 15 year old nympho (played by the amusing Claire Forlani), Stan Lee...what more could one ask for?? Its not his best, it has flaws, but its still classic Smith! An easy 7/10!|0.151208888422|0.154519122126|0.848791111578

Mallrats has memorable lines and scenes. Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith are stellar as well as the rest of the cast of characters except for Ben Affleck who I can do without in this movie.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113749/|Mallrats (1995)|This movie is really extremely funny.<br /><br />That is, if you are into either Comics, Science Fiction or Shopping Malls.<br /><br />The basic idea is simple: Two dumped guys try to win their girl-friends back, and their brilliant strategy is to hang around in the local shopping mall.<br /><br />What makes the movie work is the wonderful mix of slap stick humor, intelligent puns and gross sexual innuendos. The actors are excellent in their roles, and I was surprised to see Ben Affleck and Claire Forlani, two coming actors, credited for supporting roles.<br /><br />For a comic fan this movie is a awfully funny experience. But I can imagine that the film looses some of its appeal when you are not familiar with the Marvel and DC comic heroes and the strange passion (and science) of collecting comic books.<br /><br />And to everybody who has also failed in seeing a sailboat in those dumb 3-D-pictures, this movie provides some comfort...|0.0956132372269|0.155826184056|0.904386762773

Recently, The OC has made comic books cool in the form of Seth Cohen. but before there was Seth, there was Brodie.<br /><br />easily the greatest character lee has ever played and the best character that Smith has ever written, Brodie is obsessed with two things, Comics and himself. and as long as the two are together, he doesnt care. which is exactly what must be changed. ill let you find out how.<br /><br />jay and silent bob make a welcome comeback in a slightly more central role with a lot more to do. with hilarious results.<br /><br />i originally put 8 for this movie. but thinking about it again its a 10 and its going in my movies :) l8er days PaUl :)|0.25952750596|0.145940258598|0.74047249404
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101414/|Beauty and the Beast (1991)|I like Disney movies. Either theyre a fanciful adaptation of a fairy tale, or if not, they are visually exciting. Beauty and the Beast is by far one of Disneys best. Its an adorable story with romance, comedy, and a little slapstick action. The characters are really well developed, particularly Belle, the Beast and the many implements of the house that play significant roles. They also provide the humor. The clock Cogsworth and the Candlestick Lumiere have a dynamic friendship with a brotherly knack for irritating each other.<br /><br />The motherly teapot, voiced by Angela Lansbury, is the calm, steady minded member of the house, and more often than not she can sets things straight.<br /><br />This really is a magical, beautiful film, almost more a work of art.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101414/|Beauty and the Beast (1991)|Its interesting that for a time, the best music written for the stage was being introduced in animated features, mostly by Disney. This is one of the best and it translated well to Broadway. From the opening sequence of Belle, with her strong character, to the dancing household items at the Beasts castle, this has got to be one of Disneys finest productions. It has heart and soul. It has Gaston, a great villain, with a great song bearing his name. He is the epitome of male chauvinism. It is remindful of Miles Gloriosus in A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. The fairy tale plays itself out with delightful pacing. The beast is a complex being who has a second chance for rebirth and reconciliation. That there are forces in the universe makes this a positive film. The scare factor is there as well, with the thorny forest of the Beast, providing a barrier to all who dare enter. It shows that love can be easy, but true love without sacrifice is empty. Until the Beast knows this his lot will continue on. The songs are complex and varied, some of the best every.

I challenge anyone who dares say that this film doesnt contain everything a musical needs: a touching romance, an evil villain prepared to ruin her romance, fantastic songs and an award winning score (very deservedly), believable characters with no wooden voicing (Angela Lansbury singing absolutely beautifully) and how many decent films have been made into a successful Broadway musical? Only with Alan Menken, Howard Ashman (and a little help from Tim Rice). It is also a dawning, as this is the only villain in any film that I have fallen in love with. Gaston rocks, and if he was real, I would marry him without a doubt. I dont care if he is an animated character: Gaston is a very, very, VERY sexy tenor, and if no one else is attracted, then you can go to hell!|0.145671504326|0.26905642729|0.854328495674

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101414/|Beauty and the Beast (1991)|Beauty and the Beast is a classic love story that anyone will enjoy, whether youre a small child, a teenager, an adult, or an elderly person. Its a film thats charming, elegant, and sweet, not to mention funny. The songs are fantastic, and share the honor with Aladdin and The Lion King of having the best lineup of songs. I guarantee youll remember at least three of them for years to come, including Be Our Guest, and the classic Beauty and the Beast. The story follows Belle, a beautiful girl living in an rural area. She has always lived to assist her father, a desperate inventor who seems to be losing his marbles. When he goes off to an inventors show and gets lost, Maurices horse returns to Belle, and they set off to find him. Maurice is discovered in a colossal castle, filled with mysterious inhabitants, including the master, a fierce and horrifying beast. Belle persuades the Beast to take her instead of her father, and thus the story begins. Belle soon discovers there could be so much more to this beast than rage and hair (laughs). Filled with excellent actors including the late Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury, B&B is simply excellent, a beautiful romance that will attract any viewer to its unavoidable charm. As quoted in the song, its a tale as old time, song as old as rhyme, Beauty and the Beast.<br /><br />8/10 --spy|0.103272702825|0.776620344613|0.896727297175

Are you more the the fun parts, you still wont be disappointed. Character like LeFou, Lumiere and Cogsworth makes you laugh time after time, and parents can also find them self laughing of the sweet Chip.

From the design of the Beasts awesomely monolithic castle to the heart-stopping, Busby Berkley-inspired dance of china and silver in Be Our Guest, this is one of the most rigorously constructed animated films Ive seen.

It has a feisty, book loving heroine, a gorgeous beast, entertaining support & a vile villain. Plus enchanting songs & colourful, detailed animation. My favourite character is Chip, the little teacup, who has a vital role to play. Alas, the gorgeous beast is eventually replaced, but thats for sake of the fairy tale. What we didnt need was a new musical number. Its just an unnecessary filler in that spoils the pace of the film. Be sure to watch to the end of the credits. Theres a wonderful dedication to Howard Ashman. The voicework is fantastic & best of all, the film is in classic 2d. Its a shame we see less & less of that style nowadays. With notable exceptions like Ice Age, 3d animation lacks the uniqueness & charm of traditional films. CGI doesnt have to flaunt itself.

They get to know each other and fall in love gradually. Not like in Snow White where Snow White and Prince Charming fall in love because they both think that the other is hot. That sort of thing doesnt happen in real life, if someone in real life loved someone else without even knowing their name. Ide feel really, really, really bad for that couple.

Songs like Beauty and the Beast, Be Our Guest, and Belle are catchy and fun to listen to. It features first-class characters: the quirky Belle; Gaston, the hateful attractive villain; the Beast, a character one cant help but feels sorry for; the enchanted objects - Mrs. Potts, Cogsworth, and Lumiere, characters that bring a lighthearted quality to the movie. Beauty and the Beast also features excellent executed animation. It isnt hard to tell all the talent, the sweat, and the heart that was put in this film. The ballroom sequence, and the sequence that shows when the beast becomes human are among the most outstanding animated sequences in recent cinema.<br /><br />Beauty and the Beast is great in another aspect: its ageless. Although it appears to be a children-oriented film, it doesnt take much for an adult to find it extraordinarily appealing. Its a fabulous film for the whole family to watch and enjoy.<br /><br />When I first saw Beauty and the Beast, I fell in love with it. Its a beautiful tale, an engaging musical, and wonderful fable of romance. One of the greatest examples of traditional animation in recent years, it will go down in history with other beautiful Disney masterpieces, like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia, and Cinderella.|0.0891082809297|0.72023806776|0.91089171907

Our story takes part in France in 18 century, and our main character Belle is the prettiest girl in the city she lives, being the object of the affection and interest of Gaston, an arrogant man that has the sympathy of the people of the region.(And also considered a big catch for the girls of the city)But Belle is not interested in him and always imagined her life different from the domestic life people always imagine for her.One day, Belles father, an inventor, was going to sell one of his inventions and lost his ways, being attacked by wild animals and entering in a big dark mansion apparently without a owner. He stays there for a time, but soon the Beast comes up and attacks him,making him a prisoner in his castle.Belle stays worried and goes after her father in the mansion and there she sees the violent and awful beast who locked her father.

I sincerely hope that does not become a lost art form.<br /><br />So, first point for the movie: its French. I adore the language and the culture, so getting a smattering is a delight.<br /><br />Secondly, its a classic fairytale that is also quite dark. There is much tragedy woven into to castle and its surroundings. I like best the tales that arent overly bubbly, and this one keeps the goofiness down pretty well.<br /><br />Next, the heroine actually possesses some intelligence! She reads and has her own mind, and, unlike many, is flawed. Its nice that the film was taken seriously enough to have some dimension, even if it was only an animated movie. Plus, I really want to have her library someday.<br /><br />Lastly- the movie is just so beautiful! The castle and the woods were gorgeous, the ballroom was beautiful, but the best was the breathtaking scene right after Belle dumps Gaston and runs out to the field behind her house. Sheer perfection. No wonder this movie was nominated for best picture. My only wish- I would have liked to have seen some more of the Beast as Adam.

Beauty is much more than just an influential animated classic. It is a grand and powerful fable, sugar coated with the best animation effort in a time where CGI was becoming a movie mainstay. In its finest moments, Beauty is a rousing musical, making your head move and getting caught up right in the mix. The score is unforgettable and the characters are so easy to get into. A movie that children and adults alike will love, Disney deserved its Academy Award nominations for creating such a joy.<br /><br />Small town Belle longs for more than a local life, maintaining her imagination through books and taking care of her kind, yet eccentric father. But when their horse returns without papa, Belle sets out to find the awful truth in an enchanted castle.<br /><br />You can see that so much time and care was spent in drawing this masterpiece. I cannot think of many other movies that show such meticulous background and animation. That such effort is woven effortlessly into its songs that make Beauty and the Beast the timeless classic Disney rightfully lauds itself over. Be Our Guest, Beauty and the Beast, Gaston, you will be humming these songs at one point in your your life! Kudos to Disney for creating a charismatic, attractive villain in Gaston. He would not be a villain if he was not such a jerk. You must watch this movie at least once in your life, in a comfortable sofa and with the sound turned right up for the Broadway scores.

Its a movie that appeals to children of all ages, especially adults : )<br /><br />enough of the technical stuff lets get on to my emotional attachment to the movie.<br /><br />I remember the first time I saw B&tB so vividly; I was completely enthralled by the movie that all I could do on the way home was smile and cry. Ive seen it many, many times, yet the ballroom scene still gives me goose bumps. Angela Landsbury as Mrs. Potts sings the title song with so much feeling that every time I hear the song, Im swept away back to that ballroom.<br /><br />I was also moved by Belles strength of self worth and generosity. She is a heroine Id love girls to emulate. She knows what she wants, but yet is sensitive to others in trying to achieve that goal. She also learns to apologize and to forgive, no small task.<br /><br />Ive loved this movie from the start, and it has grown into an obsession. I collect everything I can now, and watch it when I need a lift. So I know my opinion is strongly biased : ) but I hope you get a chance to see this film and judge for yourself. I realize it is difficult to get access to the videos or laser discs (check out the spanish version cover imdb is using in B&tBs page) but it is well worth the search. The first time is most magical. I envy you.<br /><br />|0.261582633656|0.129236122873|0.738417366344
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118744/|Hush (1998)|Hush is a film that lacks credibility because the plot is more or less unbelieveable. The mother character (Played by Jessica Lange) has a dream that she believes must be fulfilled at any costs. On route to this happening, the story is wasted by using unnecessary characters, loathsome acting and what seems to be the same scenes shot over and over.<br /><br />Jessica Lange is the highlight of this film. Her performances always seem to steal the show and it is no different here. Now if her choice of films to make were a little wiser, she probably wouldnt have signed on here. Palthrow does well with what she has. Those expecting a Shakespeare like performance wont get one because the credibility of the plot takes away from all of the performances. Gwyneth has few opportunities to really act and for some reason is always having her face touched. Why?<br /><br />The cinematography is average mainly because of the natural beauty of Virginia in the (early?) winter. The film progresses at a torrid pace during the first half-hour without any character build-up that would have formed a bond with the audience. As a scene ends it always seems to tell what is going to happen in the next and this is rather annoying as well. The director only wanted to rush to get to the climax of the film not saving time for any real development.<br /><br />I dont see how one could really like this film, since it lacks so much. Watching the scene with Lange and the grandmother at the retirement home is about as bad as it gets. There is really no point to that scene of the entire film itself.<br /><br />4/10 stars.|0.775897951936|0.17657004831|0.224102048064

The screenplay is utterly predictable despite the fact that everything has to go totally wrong - or the characters act really stupid - in order to push the plot along.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118744/|Hush (1998)|I went to see Shakespeare In Love because it won the Oscar for Best Picture. I didnt like it (simply not my cup of tea), but I just loved Gwyneth Paltrow. One of the most wonderful performances of the decade. Then I saw Great Expectations, another delightful performance, and right now shes one of my favorite actresses. What do you do when someones your fave actress? You scan their filmography looking for other movies to watch. I ran through Paltrows list on IMDb and came across Hush. The 4.5 average rating didnt look too promising. Then my sis also told me she thought this movie was awful, but I decided to rent it anyway.<br /><br />The movie tells the story about Helen, Jackson and his mother Martha. Helen gets pregnant, they marry and go live with Martha in her giant house. Marthas very possessive over Jackson. More and more it becomes clear Marthas not the nice mother-in-law she appeared to be. Shes spreading lies between the two lovers and things get worse. This all leads to a, looking back on it, predictable sequence of scenes.<br /><br />But... theres Jessica Lange. She plays Martha. She really got on my nerves. Actually, when the movie was over I completely hated her. She does a fantastic acting performance. I really wanted to strangle her sometimes. Her character that is. Gwyneth Paltrow plays a quite vulnerable and likable young woman. That combined with the evil Lange caused this movie to be suspenseful for me. Really. It was predictable, but it was the kinda movie where we (I anyway) so want the heroine to win over the evil character. It is not the best movie ever made, but I was really sucked into it, especially because of Langes perfect portrayal of an utter bitch.<br /><br />So I cant believe why this movie only got 4.5 out of 10 here on IMDb.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118744/|Hush (1998)|This movie starring Jessica Lange and Gwyneth Paltrow has great talent, but the production company obviously spent all its money on the stars salaries. A film about Kentucky Thoroughbred racing should be filmed in Kentucky, not at a show horse farm in Virginia. The Kentucky Blue Grass region is uniquely identifiable, as is Virginia horse country -- and the two are not interchangeable, even in fiction. It is like making a film about New York City in Los Angeles. Did they think no one would notice? And there are plenty of Thoroughbreds in Virginia, so why did the filmmaker try to pass off big, fat show horses as racehorses? The scene at the horse sale and all its errors are even too ridiculous to mention.<br /><br />The technical adviser on this film was either asleep or inept, because a scene does not pass without a glowing inaccuracy. Especially noticeable to anyone interested in horses who watches this movie (and I cant imagine anyone else would) are the dangerous ways in which the horses are handled, usually by people who are recognizable as amateurs at handling a horse. The most glaring fax pas surrounds the drug oxytocin that Jessica Langes character removes from the cabinet: the label clearly states erythromycin tablets. Again, did the filmmaker think no one would notice? <br /><br />Literary license is one thing, but this movie goes way, way beyond that and into the depths of the toilet.|0.670726570145|0.162374238189|0.329273429855
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118744/|Hush (1998)|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it ten years ago. The film reminded me of some of my favorite Hitchcock flicks, namely Shadow of a Doubt and Notorious. The story builds slowly and generates just enough paranoia of impending danger to keep the audience interested. By the time everything comes together, the audience has an emotional investment in the main character and experiences genuine anxiety at her ordeal. This is so refreshingly different from the movies that slice and dice cardboard characters in an attempt to generate suspense.<br /><br />After seeing how poorly people have reacted to this film, I revisited it to see if my memory served me correctly. My assessment remains the same. Jessica Lange gives a stellar performance as the homicidal control freak. Gwyneth Paltrow is easy to empathize with as the paranoid daughter-in-law. Nina Foch is hysterical as the cheerful old lady who knows all the family secrets. I have met each of these characters in the real world. The only reason I would hesitate to call this a masterpiece is because there is no Hitchcock cameo. Still, this is a worthy imitation of the masters work.|0.187618019094|0.145176490942|0.812381980906

Hardly a scene goes by without her lighting up or hitting the bottle and her Blanche Devereaux accent is anything but subtle. Judging by the evidence on hand Jonathan Darby couldnt direct traffic but he certainly knows how to write genuine shockers: Get up! You think youre an alley cat, dropping its litter by the side of the road?! Jessica makes the most of the over-ripe dialogue so its worth a look, but if you want to see it in a good movie check out Wild at Heart, with a deservedly Oscar-nominated Dianne Ladd as the ultimate evil, martini-swigging southern matriarch.|0.51564521579|0.162170221931|0.48435478421
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118744/|Hush (1998)|An absolutely awful movie I watched only because of Gwyneth Paltrow who I had previously admired greatly. Not so much now. Shame on her for being party to this load of rubbish. It started off quite promisingly, well actually the wheels didnt start coming off until burglary/attack on Paltrow when it was blatantly and painfully obvious that the mother had arranged this. No explanation of the reason for this. Things went rapidly downhill from there, yes the scenery was attractive if you like that sort of thing but credit for that is due to mother nature not the cinematographer. I think the second worst aspect, after the terrible story line, was Langes acting.<br /><br />Incidentally, Oxytocin is rendered useless in the digestive system and is only effective if absorbed through the mucous membranes or given intravenously, and even then has a half life of 3 minutes I believe, so it would be totally useless taken in food. Also if my mother-in-law had treated me like that when I was in labour and then tried to kill me with a lethal injection I would not have stayed in the house even for a dramatic denouement the next morning.<br /><br />Then the son, after being led around by the nose by the evil mother does a complete about face in the space of a few minutes on the strength of his wifes unsubstantiated accusations.<br /><br />A rubbish movie best avoided.|0.882011634865|0.156978680896|0.117988365135

It lacks any coherence and cannot really convince, even if you watch the film without too much attention (like I did). **Warning: major SPOILERS ahead!** The end is the worst: Jackson got very close to his mother - then one morning Helen tells him she tried to kill her, and he immediately believes her, changes his mind and decides to leave. Even worse: having found out that the woman is a deranged murderer who already killed her husband, they just leave her there without doing anything about it (what about calling the police!?), and go on to leave happily ever after.

No phony props or gussied-up stars need apply for this amazing blend of humor and pathos, centering on Tommy Basilio, a drifting, booze-loving, socially inept, confused 20-something, who is in the throes of a pre mid-life crisis. Steve Buscemis genius lies his total absorption of the central character and his ability to extract much of the same from his fellow actors. One is totally immersed in the middle class consciousness of this typical Long Island suburb to the point that you actually feel you are watching this happen on a sidewalk in the town, rather than in a theater or on TV.<br /><br />You gotta love the character interaction between him and Chloe S. from the ice-cream truck to the Munchkin song. The cameo-ish performances of T. Lapaglia, Sam Jackson, etc. really augment the story line impeccably.

What unfolds is a very sensitive portrayal of the loneliness and hunger that drive a sometimes unfounded sense of optimism drowning in indulgence. Everything about this movie struck a positive chord within me. Its flawless, meaning, not one scene made me wince.<br /><br />Steve B is a both a tremendous writer, actor and director.|0.112010210659|0.0641418587589|0.887989789341
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117958/|Trees Lounge (1996)|From the quirkiest of the quirky, Steve Buscemi premieres his first film with a nuclear blast. The cast, which most have gone on to really big films, all artfully create the character study which is what Trees Lounge really happens to be. Each cast member should be awarded an Oscar for how real they portray this sad set of characters. Like a step into the daily wrongness of a typical craphole which can be anywhere in the USA, Buscemis breakout performance as the alcoholic ice cream man captures a rawness of how a man can be degraded so swiftly in the morays and questionable social structures that permeate our culture. Brilliantly written, Buscemi makes the assumption of just how relationships are all based in fear and the fact of this fear is why the characters act out and react as they do throughout this film but as we all do in the real world as well. When looking for a slice of life that reminds us just how not to be, Trees Lounge is the perfect example. This film is a triumph.|0.240613447427|0.154883304175|0.759386552573
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117958/|Trees Lounge (1996)|This is real life stuff at its best. Two hours flew by while I was watching this movie because I felt like I was there at Trees Lounge. It was like I had my own barstool just watching what was going on.<br /><br />The character development is superb. Even though nothing much happens in the movie that is really profound, you feel like you are rewarded by watching because you get to know the characters, especially Tommy, played by Buschemi. You can almost feel that he is not really acting in this role...it feels more like he is re-living part of his life experience in the movie.<br /><br />It is a slice of life from the outskirts of NYC or Nothern NJ that seems like it would actually happen.|0.658222119986|0.140740824083|0.341777880014
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117958/|Trees Lounge (1996)|This great flick is directed by and stars well know character actor, Steve Buscemi as Tommy Basillo. Tommy has lost his girl, lost his job, and now doesnt really know what to do. After a weak attempt to find work, he ends up driving an ice cream truck directly into the cross hairs of an old, violent friend played by Daniel Baldwin. Other cast include a younger and thinner Anthony Lapaglia of Without A Trace fame, Mark Boone Jr. who now appears in the FX series, Sons of Anarchy, and a special appearance by Samuel L. Jackson. It is basically a day in the life of a regular Joe. Another good film directed by Steve Buscemi is Lonesome Jim.. It stars some of the same actors and the always beautiful, Liv Tyler. If you like Trees Lounge youre safe with Lonesome Jim.. So enjoy!|0.396291950441|0.837247470773|0.603708049559
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117958/|Trees Lounge (1996)|After looking forward to seeing this movie directed ,written by and starring one of my favourite actors Steve Buscemi and with a big name cast I was left disappointed . This film tried to be funny and failed miserably at every turn and the story really dragged on at 95 minutes although it felt longer . The characters I couldnt relate to and the relationships between all characters werent believable . Buscemi has tried to portray himself as the lovable loser and we are meant to laugh at his shortcomings , however I must concede Buscemi is the best character in the film the rest I found irritating .<br /><br />Of course this is merely an opinion and Buscemi fans should give it a watch anyway I just personally never enjoyed it at all .|0.541629594293|0.165277861837|0.458370405707
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117958/|Trees Lounge (1996)|Steve Buscemi plays a loser who hangs around a bar called the Trees Lounge, who keeps making his own life worse. He picks fights with his friends, loses jobs, and generally gets drunk and gets into trouble. Theres a great scene where Buscemi takes a job as an ice-cream truck driver, hes completely the wrong person to do the job. Still, the movie doesnt really have many happy or fun moments, its the portrayal of a guy who just doesnt care anymore and wants to spend his time hanging around a bar with a bunch of other regulars with no aim in life but the next drink. This movie is not as fun, clever, interesting or memorable as it could have been, its hard to care about any of the characters, they live such boring, banal lives, and there arent any quotable lines in the movie.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117958/|Trees Lounge (1996)|TREES LOUNGE is a film about Tommy Basilio , an unemployed mechanic who spend most of his time drinking in a bar or snorting drugs .  What`s so compelling about this movie ?  you ask , well I think you`ve hit the nail on the head with that question because there`s nothing really compelling about TREES LOUNGE . It`s a really low concept ( ie character based story ) movie where not much happens . Written , directed and starring Steve Buscemi it feels like one of those indie projects actors come up with now and again to increase their cred with major Hollywood studios and I`m guessing Buscemi ploughed much of his own money into the project so maybe I shouldn`t be too critical <br /><br />!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!<br /><br />I should perhaps also give some praise to Buscemi for writing a screenplay with an obvious subtext of never getting what you want : Tommy want`s to snort yet more drugs but someone comes into the bathroom , Tommy wants to take a woman he`s picked up in a bar but she falls asleep while he`s in the bathroom , a young kid wants to buy an ice cream but the ice cream man suddenly has a heart attack , so the theme to this movie is very clear .

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117958/|Trees Lounge (1996)|Just happened upon this channel hopping In the early hours saw Steve Buscemi and wondered whats going on here? Not a lot as It seemed but thats not the point. Just sit back - preferably with a lager and allow Trees Lounge to charm your trousers off.<br /><br />Wonderfully subdued comedy showing that Buscemi Is not only a cult anti hero on screen but that he has much promise as a director. The characters stand out as they can be related to - everyone will recognise the Bill type regular permanently attached to the counter. Mark Boones wife also as a seriously difficult woman who hasnt a clue what she really wants, stereotypically so. Tommy yes, Is a manchild aimlessly squandering his life away, for sure It Isnt a good role model to aspire to approaching middle age but hey thats his perogative.<br /><br />This Is Steves film and hes got charisma by the barrow full to make Trees Lounge a real treat. That trick with the glasses will work once - provided your not too hammered practising. But Its Uncle Al who gets the best lines - he loves your mothers, his excuse for his lecherous behaviour on the couch will bail a lot of people out of a lot of trouble.<br /><br />This film Is very hard to track down, 90% of video shops I went to hadnt even heard of It and Its been on terrestrial Tele twice - once a week late- the reward Is well worth the effort.|0.660379478129|0.199859283339|0.339620521871
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117958/|Trees Lounge (1996)|Watched this with some trepidation, having seen the absolutely excellent trailer. So few movies live up to their trailers, especially indies. Anxiety increased by having read Buscemis fairly harrowing account of making the film in one of those The Directors books.<br /><br />Shouldnt have worried. Great flick. Totally engrossing, especially to a *cough* former *cough* barfly like myself. Beautifully understated, funny, very sad, nicely paced and Buscemi very wisely NOT trying to dominate every scene, although he certainly dominates the movie.<br /><br />Movie appears on first sight plot less but actually it isnt at all: Buscemis search for a second chance to escape from the morass of his own making is riveting. Everyone involved seems to have had a good time and the beautifully relaxed performances are the reward. Only the two knucklehead goombahs fall below the otherwise uniformly excellent level.<br /><br />A real treat, and thoroughly watchable-again able. My DVD was in TV format, which sucked, but otherwise the low budget doesnt really intrude.<br /><br />Nearest movie to it I can think of offhand is KILLING OF A Chinese BOOKIE. Radically different subject matter but similar bittersweet texture.<br /><br />A slightly, but only slightly, generous 9/10 from me.|0.261776312853|0.13323412704|0.738223687147
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117958/|Trees Lounge (1996)|Excellent film dealing with a group of unhappy people who drown their sorrows in booze, powder, and sex. The chief sorrowmeister, Tommy, was a pathetic loser who spent inordinate amounts of time swilling beer and shots in a shabby bar which boasted a temperamental barkeep, a postage stamp sized mens room, and one table. When not turning his liver into plywood Tommy halfheartedly attempts to find work as a mechanic but winds up driving his uncles ice cream wagon and getting in over his head with a troubled teen on the verge of bolting from daddys violent household. A sad picture for sure, but I couldnt help laughing out loud at some of these characters antics.

This is a story that is hard to tell, let alone find an audience. Although many can relate with the cast of lost souls hanging out at a bar most of the day, many will not admit to being somewhat connected to any of the characters. Filmed for less that 2 million, this independent, low budget, and somewhat of a masterpiece is brilliant as well as entertaining. Much of the cast has gone on to do other known films. Carol Kane, Mark Boone Junior Steve Buscemi, Bronson Dudley, Anthony LaPaglia and Steves brother Michael Buscemi star in this Minnie and Moskowitz type story.

Trees Lounge however presents mme with one of the rare movies that I wish were longer. I wanted this movie to keep going, I wanted to see what else would happen to the characters. While the film doesnt entirely paint the happy bar room existence that Barfly did it does make a pretty accurate portrail of good portion of the drinkers culture. Every actor in this movie hits just the right note especially Chloe Sevigny, who has never looked more fetching. One of those silly Baldwins even turns in a fine performance.

Tommys character, while on the surface, demands both pity and sympathy. Its in his anti-heroic attributes ie. selfishness and callousness, that make the film so human and believable.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117958/|Trees Lounge (1996)|Whenever one thinks of Steve Buscemi the actor, one probably thinks of the line about his character in FARGO, where a girl says, Well, he was funny looking...more than most people, even. That has more or less summed up the parts Buscemi has played throughout the years, way back to the mini-series of LONESOME DOVE. But hes got more range than that, as he showed in LIVING IN OBLIVION(1995), and this movie, which he also wrote and directed. The nice surprise is he also has the makings of a fine writer and director. Theres no real plot here, which undoubtedly will throw some people(and has, if some of the comments are any indication), just observing a certain type of people(working-class and barflies) and how they live their lives. While it may drag at times, theres enough truth and detail to keep you interested. Buscemi also directs actors well; this is the film which convinced me Chloe Sevigny was for real.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082509/|Heavy Metal (1981)|People watching Heavy Metal for the first time with on prior knowledge of the magazine or the basic concept of the movie, like me, will undoubtedly give you mixed reviews.<br /><br />Some will love the violence, sex, humor and all-around edginess. Some will hate the animation (which is good in some instances and frustrating at its worst). The degree of nudity seemed a bit intense when I began watching it, but I quickly adapted to this stylistic choice.<br /><br />On its own, it isnt a particularly good movie. Its Tarentino narrative style and dropped-in-the-middle exposition cant help but upset if youre not expecting it. The reason the film is called Heavy Metal isnt even readily apparent (unless youve done your research and discovered that it is, in fact, based off of something else).<br /><br />But, if youre willing to look past those things that irk cinema fans, and if you picked up this little cult piece you probably are, either being an animation fan or just a free spirit, its a rather satisfying film. The emotions and ideas of the film come together if you are willing to take some of the other elements with a grain of salt. Some people may hate it, others herald it as a masterpiece. I just think its so bad its good. That warrants it a 7 in my book.|0.353184970258|0.132692308314|0.646815029742
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082509/|Heavy Metal (1981)|I was lucky enough to see this with my dad (cool guy) when I was a kid at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. At the time the only animated movies that you would get to see were Disney type stuff so this totally blew my mind. The soundtrack was and is so cool, you never heard heavy metal music in movies or on the radio for that matter(well OK maybe on after midnight on Sunday if you got the tinfoil just right.) so needless to say it was an experience Ill never forget. If you have not seen it yet then by all means rent it..............My comments are not the minimum length for comments of ten lines of text so I will add some more. Movie goers maybe a little more jaded now (Me included) but this movie still holds up. The b-17 segment still is as exciting and creepy as it was when I first saw it.

If it were made now, it would be slicker than slick, void of soul, with the wretched music of our age providing the soundtrack. Heavy Metal circa 1981 has the texture and imperfect beauty that sustaining, lasting art must possess; think Miles Davis Bi*ches Brew or Sketches of Spain, or the Rolling Stones Exile on Main Street - thats where Heavy Metal lives. Its not perfect, parts of it are quite flawed, but as a whole, even the flaws are beautiful gems to behold, and I tell you, for every voice barking on about Heavy Metals flaws being too much to take, I say this: you take your Saw and remakes of Texas Chainsaw and The Omen and whatever else your fetid college brains latch onto as broken things that need fixing, and well take Heavy Metal and the original versions of the horror movies mentioned and be artistically far richer. But youre not after richness in art, are you? Youre after eye-candy and digitally rendered starscapes, arent you? Yes, you are. And youre beggars with moldy bread because of it.<br /><br />Heavy Metal is a classic, and Ill be first to admit that its got problems, but believe it or not, problems sometimes add to a classics being considered a classic in the first place.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082509/|Heavy Metal (1981)|This movie came out when I was 17 and I remember going to the Midnight Movie on Ridge Road in Griffith, IN. Everyone in the theater was also in high school or just out. It is what it is, a silly movie with great music. I was the designated driver and therefore was not drunk or high as my friends were. My other friend was also a DD and even though we didnt get the same feeling from it as our drunken friends, we did really enjoy the music and watching some people get sick and in a few cases pee on themselves. If you are looking for some intellectual Dumbo jumbo, move along. However, if youre looking for a cartoon with great music than go ahead and watch this. At 44, I dont consider myself part of the older generation but I guess at 17 I probably thought it was. Im not old, your music today really does suck!|0.545357346441|0.139903393727|0.454642653559
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082509/|Heavy Metal (1981)|This has to easily be the worst movie Ive ever seen. <br /><br />Admittadly, I saw this movie AFTER I saw Heavy Metal 2000, so I might be biased in my thoughts/opinions. <br /><br />While there are some O.K. Parts to this movie, 95% of it is worthless drible. <br /><br />The Animation is AWFUL by todays standards. Even in 1980 (4 years before I was born) it probably looked like garbage. It looks like a bad Sci Fi Beavis and Butthead. <br /><br />The story makes little sense. Of course, you dont watch these types of movies for plot, but they could have at least tried (like HVM 2000 -the plot wasnt much but at least it was there). <br /><br />The music is a bunch of 80s style Hard Rock. While middle-aged viewers might enjoy this music, I cant see anyone else enjoying it.<br /><br />The violence and nudity are all that anyone could possibly like about this movie. And if you really want that, then you could watch HVM 2000.<br /><br />Overall, 1/10.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082509/|Heavy Metal (1981)|This is one of the most boring films Ive ever watched. I really like anime, and thought I was gonna have real fun with this one. It seemed to be a myth to many people. <br /><br />The first story is quite great, with that cynic taxi driver, and the voluptuous girl. Also good animation, different to anything Ive seen before, and really refreshing. But thats all, only 10 minutes of joy. The 2 I give to this film is due to this first story, without it, it would be a 0.<br /><br />The next chapters are just a collection of naked girls and nonsense action. Action is not even spectacular, just nonsense and boredom. The animation becomes ordinary, just medium quality, similar to Heeman series and things like that. Theres even some chapter without naked girls at all, what just turns them into below 0 crap xD.<br /><br />Theres only another story thats not so bad as the rest of the film. Its that one of the zombies in the plane. Great animation and a quite disturbing atmosphere. Unfortunately, at that time I was so bored that I couldnt enjoy it properly. <br /><br />Theres one chapter particularly stupid, 7 or 8 minutes just to make a joke about cocaine. And besides, the joke is not funny, just silly. It seems it pretends to be politically incorrect or corrosive, its just childish and stupid.<br /><br />The ending, that fight between the girls, is so predictable and typical like a telefilm. And the real ending, with the green sphere, wants to be mysterious and even transcendental. I thought it was pathetic. Like if somebody was going to spend a second thinking about this movie. <br /><br />So if you have to choose between this and any other animation movie, choose any other animation movie, youll have chosen right. And if you wanna see a really good anime, with loads of action, just take Blood: The Last Vampire.<br /><br />Marcuse.|0.652980298443|0.148363095964|0.347019701557

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082509/|Heavy Metal (1981)|This movie is barely worth criticizing. Ironically, it could have been an interesting movie. I liked Sci-fi more as a kid but still think it has its place, and the premise of linked tales in the future is not a bad one. Even the mix of the exotic and mundane in the future had some potential. However, this movie took the easy way out and went for stories that almost all hit below the belt. Even the animation was a disappointment because it was so sub-par--more like a bad version of those forgettable Saturday morning Transformers cartoons that started running in the 80s--Warner Bros. and Disney did it much better decades ago. Shame on anyone involved in this piece of trash. Since when does the future have to be overrun almost exclusively by trashy people? The creators tried unsuccessfully to mask poorly written stories and cheaply drawn animation with hard core violence, meaningless adolescent fantasy sex, and illicit drug use. Wow. What creativity. If their aim was to appeal to socially misfit adolescent males brimming with violent urges and unfulfilled lust, then they hit their mark.. <br /><br />Not recommended for anyone with a modicum of taste or decency but perfect for wannabe serial killers and misfit males mentally stuck in their teens. . 2/10|0.743738119692|0.134126994415|0.256261880308

Well, I guess it was just marketing. Heavy metal was the most popular music in those days, so they filled the soundtrack with bands such as Nazareth, Blue Oyster Cult or Black Sabbath (let it be said in passing that those werent 100% heavy metal bands, they were more like hard rock bands). Maybe they thought that way thousands of long-haired rockers would fill the theatres to overflowing.<br /><br />*My rate: 3/10|0.583638363014|0.161324288444|0.416361636986

The first part with the taxi driver is almost ok! The rest is very meaningless. I rented this because it was refereed to as one of the first adult-orientated cartoons. Í cannot speak for the others, but for myself I believe that adult is more than (boring) sex and (boring) violence and gore. The worst thing about this movie is the total lack of story. Good against evil has never been portrayed so.. shallow and uninteresting.<br /><br />Normally I love cartoons, both anime and western, and therefore gave this one a long line before it broke...<br /><br />PDD|0.831397903699|0.124060459748|0.168602096301

Its just a series of junkily animated shorts (adapted from good comic books) held together by a nonsense frame story. Each short is either poorly animated, completely boring, or both.

International product financed through the Canadian Film Development Corporation (which would explain the mostly Canadian-born voice-over talent, including John Candy, Harold Ramis, and Joe Flaherty) and distributed stateside by Columbia. The screenplay by Daniel Goldberg and Len Blum (utilizing original stories from several talented writers, including Dan OBannon) may intrigue youthful audiences, yet these plots fail to pop and the thing seems to last a lifetime. Worse, the look of the film is gloppy, with ugly color-schemes and foregrounds which are hardly intriguing. It made a decent (if erratic) record album, but as a movie it fails. * from ****|0.498933845237|0.179282495524|0.501066154763

It was fun because it was a cartoon with violence, gore, aliens getting high and naked chicks with big boobs. I saw it again this year and I thought it sucked. First of all, there has been a lot of adult cartoons in the past 20 years so the shock effect just wasnt there. It is also very uneven. It is basically a collection of 10 minutes not-really-related sketches put together by different persons, and it shows. The animation quality of many of the sketches is below the average Saturday morning cartoon. Pretty bad. 3/10.|0.55873402337|0.184565483594|0.44126597663
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082509/|Heavy Metal (1981)|what are a cartoon! but why in the 80s? And why the name heavy metal? Naked women in a cartoon and action and humor, amazing, I bet the heavy metal 2 sucked since it wasnt like the first one. Can you believe in one scene, they showed that kids penis. Ew. The boobs. oh yeah but the penis, ew. It was kind of cool how they mixed it with a suspense, drama, musical (by music they must mean by the heavy metal bands in the 80s) horror, fantasy and sci-fi. the woman in the beginning who had sex with that man, why did she have to die?!! For a cartoon character, shes thick. Also the part when she fell asleep in the cab, you could see that blue thong and the sex scene, INTENSE!!! big ass titties, a lot of hair on her penisless area. Big nipples to dont forget. nice black lip stick. If I were a girl, would a still enjoy the movie? (Because there was nothing but girl nudity and one scene male nudity) The ass and the penis. For the women, the boobs an vagina. for god sakes please make another. Anyway, I wonder if it was previously rated x in the very late 70s because the thing came out in 81. Maybe R? come on. NC-17 could be good. Is X only a flick rating or also a movie rating. I was wrong. Its a movie rating also. Scarface (in the 80s) was previously rated x go to mpaa.org and see for yourself. Im the first kid (in 2006) to probably see heavy metal. Sex with robot, sex with woman in control, sex with double crosser, a criminal with something thousand rapes. remember that part? good times. They only played it on Direct TV once and then it doesnt come on anymore. Why? They play flicks like at 10:00 or 11:00 (Which I dont watch. I only know the name because when I change the channel to the channel its on, itll show the name) Im gonna call them and ask them to put it back on direct TV.|0.617766121703|0.165899344155|0.382233878297

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082509/|Heavy Metal (1981)|This movie is pretty sad, the animation is terrible, especially when compared with a lot of stuff that was coming out of Japan at the same time(Vampire Hunter D). For some reason all the vignettes seem to have a really weak plot that involves either gratuitous violence or naked cartoon women with lots of t&a. Not to mention that the device used to interlink the stories is a glowing green orb that is the source of all evil in the universe, again not that impressive. Granted that many anime films seem to find a way to show quite a bit of naked people and violence, at least they do so with an engaging and intersting plot that contains the viewers interest rather than being something that looks like it was written by some blocked eighth grader looking to show naked women and lots of blood.|0.81185222402|0.0688033561322|0.18814777598

Yes, there was some good material in the early issues but there was a lot of crap, too. Too bad the crappy elements of HM are all that seemed to make it into this movie... a series of short sci-fi/fantasy cartoons linked by the lame device of some evil, sentient green jewel that sets out to kill the one person that can destroy it... but first, its going to tell its victim several irrelevant stories. Most of the stories are based on some of the best cartoons from the early years of HM... but the transition to animation doesnt do them any justice. The best cartoon of the bunch, Captain Stern is but a pale, pale echo of Bernie Wrightsons original 7 page strip. Every other sequence is just an endless parade of juvenile sex/drug jokes and senseless bloody violence. I guess you could argue that thats all the magazine ever was anyway... but at least there was an artistic vision behind it all. There is no art in this movie whatsoever... just clumsy animation, bad writing, crummy voice work and lousy inappropriate heavy metal music (hey, the movie is called Heavy Metal... better cram some heavy metal music in it!)

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082509/|Heavy Metal (1981)|I have to admit, I loved this movie from when I first saw it. A true cult classic, and second in Midnight Movie viewing only to Rocky Horror.<br /><br />I think one reason that this movie was looked forward to for so long is that it was unavailable for so long. I remember around 1984 when a release was planned, and a dispute with the multiple musicians caused it to be pulled. But thankfully this was finally resolved, so we can own it again.<br /><br />I bought a pirate copy when i was in Japan in 1988 (On Beta no less), and almost played it to death. And having been a fan of the comic when I could find it, I think it told the stories very well. I admit that the green sphere link was silly and did not work, and that the original carousel concept would have been much better (watch the DVD release for details on this). The simple fact that I have bought 3 copies of this time and still own all 3 of them says something about the movie.<br /><br />Harry Canyon, Den, and Taarna are the be the most remembered pieces of this movie. Each in itself could even be fleshed out to hour long length, and still be enjoyable. So Beautiful, So Dangerous is enjoyable, and Harold Ramis and John Candy steal the show with their voices (Hey man, you got any of that plutonium niborg left?). And I admit, the film version of the story was MUCH more enjoyable then the original one from the comic.<br /><br />PS: Watch for the cameo of a destroyed USS Enterprise.
